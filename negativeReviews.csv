"I went there for a family dinner . Had the set menu with BBQ chicken and naan, and believe me when I tell you I was utterly disgusted to my core as I've never had BBQ chicken or rather any food in any restaurant that bad. The chicken was bland as hell, tasted like a boiled piece of rubber and almost smelled bad . I don't know if they were having a bad day or something, but the most painful thing was it took them more than 1:30 hours to serve that 'Horror in a plate' .My parents had other set menu items which also included BBQ chicken that tasted almost as bad as mine. Though the staff behavior was good it doesn't make up for the bad food and the long wait. I don't know if my experience was an accident on their part or not but it sure was horrific .",1,,758,Negative

It used to be one of my favorite places for food but my last three visits were absolute disappointment. The chickens were so dry and tasteless. My favorite charbroiled chicken totally lost its texture and top of that they reduced the size of the chicken pieces. Hope the management take these issues seriously.,1,,310,Negative
"Quality and test of food is not great, also food is not well coordinated so you have to ended up paying high for a family dinner. Also they are not transparent when put advertisement as last week they put advert that there will be buy one get one free but didnâ€™t mention time frame so when I reach they told that time is over.",1,,328,Negative
"Used to love the food, but recently they have deteriorated very badly. The chicken seem pre-cooked and reheated, and the flavours are not as vibrant. Portions have decreased, too, so I go to Namdo's downstairs instead.",1,,218,Negative

"Went here today to have Ramadan Meal One (Jamaican grilled chicken) with my family...The meal was absolutely cold and the Jamaican grilled chicken, Chicken shashlik was hard!!! It was not delicious and filling meal at all, rather it was uneatable!!! I went there several times, but didnâ€™t have this sort of experience before. If I knew that I have to eat this shit, I would have ordered the regular menu. It is absolutely cheating.",1,,433,Negative
"The food was good. Pasta was poor. But, the no of staff are very less. Can't manage. Don't visit there on Friday. There was almost none to check your requirements. Poor very poor. You pay a lot but you don't get even 20% of the service. Needs lots of improvement in terms of customer service.",2,,292,Negative
"One should never order a pizza in this place. It was just below average standard. Home mades are far better than this. Code F 14: They attarct you by writing 20 pieces, but they don't tell you it's only a full chicken. Taka 1465 is not worthy of the plate at any standard of bd, may it be a chain shop. Code GC10: Jamaican chicken was good. Soup was good and had its signature mark with taste. Nice place but congested. ... Parking is a problem as usual. Security guards are eager for tips but has little idea of guiding a vehicle to park.",2,,539,Negative

"Went to Gulshan Branch yesterday. I usually like their food but yesterday's service was the poorest! I didn't get 10% discount on SCB credit card though my bill was above TK. 3,000! Had to asked them couple of time to provide the promotional coupon. Very much disappointed!",2,,273,Negative

"went at dinner tonight at dhanmondi branch....food was good but I have question about the manners & etiquette of waiters. While I was waiting for my guest after reserving the seats, they asked me rudely as if my guest are coming or not they have other reservation (have to mention that only half an hour passed after I took the seats and half the reserved seats are filled already!!!). After challenging them why they didn't take my reservation earlier when I called, they started... to say they wanted the seats because some ppl just came and ask for seat (I don't see those reservation ppl coming at all that night)....in between the conservation, one waiter said they did 30k per day business as if I give a damn shit about it (30k per day!!! seriously!!! as a brand like yours.......com'on man so poor!!!). After ordering the starter and 1st round of order, they seemed surprised to ask us that 5 person and only 4 dishes!!! REALLY THIS IS THE WAY YOU BEHAVE WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS!!! If someone order food cost 200tk or 20000tk, both are your customers. You should give your staff proper lesson on manners then let them serve for your brand because its degrading the brand value.",1,,1181,Negative
"I don't understand why you don't inform your customers properly about your offers for them.it is really unexpected from a brand like you.you tell clearly the offer for pizza will be available on Saturday till further notice.but the truth is different.when we reach your dhanmondi branch after a long busy traffic,you say very easily the offer has ended without prior notice.this is how you serve your customer?don't know what is important to you?customer or profit?speechless... just now I saw some other reviews,I experienced you did the same with some other guests also.",1,,572,Negative
"Environment is nice, food and prices terrible. Burger seems like only hot bread.",1,,80,Negative
Bit overpriced compared to their taste.Also the interior of dhanmondi branch is nothing special.,1,,96,Negative
Not up to the mark service... Waiters insisting having certain items from the menu... Not quality food... n irrational price range!!! Disappointing......,2,,153,Negative
"Food was ok but they robbed me by including items in the bill which I have not ordered and did not receive; I went to the cashier and before paying I have told him that I have not ordered this but he says its been billed and he is ""feeling dukkhito"" for this. I had an argument with the manager and was expecting something complimentary but he was also ""feeling dukkhito"" and said will consider me with good service next time as if I am a beggar to beg them for money or anything. I told them you all stole money and that's wrong and I don't live abroad so it does not matter whatever you do next time. VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THEM AND WILL NEVER COME BACK WHEN I AM IN BANGALDESH.",1,,680,Negative
Dhanmondi branch has the worst quality of food and the worst food quality of customer service. I have never been through such a horrible experience before. And that horrible experience incurred at a very high price. Will never visit again.,1,,239,Negative
Food was over priced and not up to the mark in taste! If you are going to charge that much the least you can do is to improve your cooking! The pasta was runny ?!?!???,1,,167,Negative

"I went to Bailey road branch. The pizza is so poor i felt it was just robbery. The cheese was very thin and the bread was thin too. The topping was also very low in quantity. It felt like , i am having a ruti with some vaji :p The behaviour was good though and that's why i am giving 2 star. Never going to try again unless the food quality improves.",2,,350,Negative
"Today we had the most awful experience at BbQ Dhanmondi branch. They have been offering the 50% discount on beverage and i liked their frappe everytime so went their tonight as it was the last night. And even though we had called at their number and verified that the store was open they denied to serve us the frappes! Not ony that, after providing us the menue the waiter was taking a while to come back. I found that the waiter and the manager was solving a dispute with ano...ther client. So called another younger waiter who was walking towards the table then the other waiter made him stop. He literally stoped him coming towards us and then he took another 5mins to solve the dispute.then this waiter and the manager had another chat, more like whispered in the years then they both came to tell they cannot serve the Frappe!!! They said they ran out of all ingredients! They literally didn't want to make the drinks as it was close to the closing time. They has an offer going on and it cannot be that they ran out of every single ingredients of all the drinks!! Even though we had said we didn't want anything else at all that being an International Chain they should be serving us they denied us completely!! I should also mention we went to the Dhanmondi branch just this friday night and the pizza was terrible too!!! It was nothing like the Gulshan branch pizza. Really really disappointed by this ignorant attitude and i doubt i will ever go back.",1,,1461,Negative
Soft drink 99+vat . :( It is too expensive. Others,1,,50,Negative
"Okay, here's an honest review. Went to the Dhanmondi Branch yesterday and the food was okay. It was nothing completely out of the ordinary and that would have been completely alright had the items not been priced premium. The service was absolutely horrible! I mean how are you guys still in business with the current lot of waiters? A waiter literally tried to force an item on us by repeatedly insisting in the rudest of manners and the most annoyed of expressions. We had to ca...ll the waiters multiple times before any of them responded, every time. No, they weren't busy, just standing at the nearest tissues counter (or something) doing absolutely nothing. It took them about 15 minutes to get the bill and another 15 to return the change. The music was too loud and they did not turn down the volume even after we requested them to. Please take note that we have not been rude to any of the servers even once through out the whole process. Now, considering the fact that the Dhanmondi branch is a relatively new outlet, the cutlery items used should still be in relatively good condition but they were not. Most of the spoons had so many scratch marks on them that it almost gave the feeling that we had been provided with used utensils from the older branches. Does not reflect the class BBQ BD claims to boast. Not a good experience overall. Not sure if I wanna go back there, not anytime soon at least. P.S.- Can provide pictures if necessary.",1,,1454,Negative
"Bbq Bangladesh Dhanmondi Branch is a big disappointment, Menu card's price of each item really differs with the price of the bill,I have tried your Gulshan branch for almost 6-7times and I loved it, no complains from there.. And 2times at your dhanmondi branch.. My experience was bad both the times there.dhanmondi branch serves completely different quality of food, it's too bad , the quantity of your pane cream soup was very low.. Taste of chicken was bad and served cold. The... second time I went there, the taste of the food was average and I clearly remember that I ordered food costing around 1500 -1600tk on the menu card( Korean Charboiled chicken 3pcs chicken, 1 piece jamaican chicken meal with mashed potatoes and 3 cocacolas). They charged me the double on their bill around 3000tk. I have calculated on my own and it would have been around 1800tk-2000tk with vat and service charge. This was a clear fraud.. This might also be an inside fraud between the manager and the waiters so the authority must take this into consideration.I am never going back to bbq bangladesh again. This was not only me who faced such a problem but also I know few more people disappointed with Bbq Bangladesh dhanmondi's bill problem.",1,,1229,Negative

"Ripping people off basically. Please kindly take business seriously if not passionately. The management is very poor and the description of their items is not true to its words.

"I ordered Golden Olive Value Meal but I cudnt find anything valuable! Whatever , this combo contains 1pc golden olive chicken ,fried cajun wedge potato, veg rice, egg n salad! At first , they forgot using salt probably :) 1) so far I know with my little knowledge, olive chicken is prepared using olive oil to fry the whole chicken n mixed up with some spices .I neither found any spice nor olive taste. 2) veg rice - hardly got vegetable, dried up rice , less quantity 3) egg ...: even an egg can taste this much worse , I didn't know , forgot using salt here also, as mentioned. 4) potato: the only thing I cud eat at least. Overall experience was worst, this dish costs 345 including Vat.I never hesitate spending if the quality and taste are satisfactory, but this place was irritating enough",1,,796,Negative

For the two parcels they said they cannot give drinks or kulfi instead they would give only one yoghurt. They literally seemed like they didn't wanted to serve us..why?? Because there was no guy with us??...even after inquiring several times they just cheated us by not serving what we paid for.....such theif waiters in a restaurant like hakka dhaka seriously??

Exactly that was happen for every customer yesterday. Another thing iftar platter for 4 Person was 4000 bdt and I was asking myself why I paid for these kind of food..

"Me and my wife went there on Baishakhi afternoon to take there Favorite meal (tk 499) meal platter during odd time. The platter was offered from 4.30 pm to 6.30 pm and we delayed our lunch just to have a taste of it. We thought to take the alternate options in our two platters so that we could have a chance to taste all the options. But when we went to order, the parser refused to give alternate options and replied that they do not take order for single platter. Even he repli...ed that if we ordered for single platter than they would refuse to serve so but it was not mentioned in anywhere in their flyer. The attitude of the parser was unfriendly. However we placed order. Then the manager came and roughly asked whats my problem. When i explained to him the issue, he became somewhat soft and said sorry. The food came. The rice and spaghetti became normal temperature and did not taste well. The mongolian beef and wrapped shrimp was good. Chicken mushroom was average. The special kulfi was good but not that much special... Overall FOOD was different, taste would be better if served hot, has areas of improvement.. Restaurant atmosphere and cleanliness was better.. But SERVICE is poor, promotional offers should be carefully designed, and the servers and managers should learn how to stay polite when they are in the wrong side of any debate... However I will go there/order online another day to get the taste of other items...",2,,1441,Negative

I know it was supposed to be dry but it's definitely not supposed to be harder than my teeth. 2) The szechuan prawn supposed to have an spicy red saucy texture. But here it's full of red grease. Looks like it came out of an old truck's engine. 3) The chicken with mushroom was okay but full of onions. Onions everywhere. 4) The dough of the dumpling was crunchy and brown. It was more like shingara. 5) The noodle was greasy and over-spicy 6) And that one star is for the fried rice which was decent.,1,,594,Negative

The restaurant is okay. The decor is decent. The stairs are totally unsafe. The menu... it has a lot of flaws. Starting with the lack of fizzy drinks to not being able to order extra sides. Not everyone wants to drink juice with a steak. I know I don't. I had to get those mini water bottles you all have that taste extremely bitter. Try to get Mum and some other mineral water brands since getting water is the only option for people who don't want those juices. Also what am I s...upposed to do if I want extra wedges? Order an entire lemon chicken platter for those 5 pieces of wedges that come with it? The menu is extremely inconvenient. The platters were decorated okay. Looked aesthetically pleasing. The wedges were the only decent sides. The rice was somewhat okay too. The mashed potato and mushrooms weren't up to the mark.

He was struggling to understand and eventually ended up giving two packs of fries. I told him that ordered the meal, there should be one pack only. Then he said you ordered 2 pcs of chicken. I explained it's the meal that I ordered. He was going back and forth... He seemed confused. I told a trainee standing next to him to ...call someone senior, the manager so that I can explain. She told the cashier instead. And he got agitated. He showed the fries pack and started saying you ordered 2 pcs chicken. The guy standing to him stepped in and took my order. He remained silent as he exchanged the cards... no thanks or apology for the confusion... nothing. To make it worse... he came upstairs after a while to clean up and kept exchanging eye contact couple of times. Don't want to put his name in public. Would be happy to inbox.",2,,988,Negative

I went to Woodhouse Grill on Friday and was shocked to see such a small restaurant with no space between tables. It seems the tables are joining each other. Their prices are quite expensive considering that this is a very small restaurant in a small congested space. The service was poor. We were told that the food would arrive 45 mins. after ordering but the food arrived later. I suggested the owner to serve all the food together at a time instead of serving each order separ...ately. We ordered a t bone steak medium well which was brought out medium rare with blood remaining inside. We also ordered a sirloin medium well which was very dry. The steaks are kept frozen and after cooking it was not at all juicy. We also ordered grill chicken which was ok. The waiters are not well trained and don't know when to serve the drinks which should have arrived right after ordering but instead I had to remind the waiter yo bring out the drinks almost 30 mins. after ordering the drinks. Its a ok place but they need to improve service quality and better quality steak.,2,,1069,Negative

The place is too small and congested. They should work hard on improving their cooking of the steak.,1,,411,Negative

"Update about the Rating: This was one of my favorite place for hanging out with fnf. But faced something awkward and irritating in my last visit. Totally unprofessional behavior, if there's some problem to serve a specific item to me then it's better not to serve the same item to other while I am in your restaurant. I tried to order a specific item but the server said this item is not available, ok cool. I have gone for another item. but a Minute later I could see and hear t...hey were taking the same item's order from the next table. I didn't want to complain about the mismanagement at the cafe as some other visitor was there, I thought it would be better If I write it down to their complain book, so I asked for their complain book but they don't have a feedback or complain book. OMG. Rather the server insisted me to complain the problem to him directly, I denied and later the manager or accountant came to explain the scenario. Now come to the food part: I had ordered ""Schezwan Chicken, Rice"" and ""Mongolian Beef"" where the quantity was really poor and it doesn't even close to Schezwan Chicken's look or taste. Mongolian Beef's beef was hard to chew and again quantity was poor too. Old Rating: I will recommend this place to have the Fresh Juice and French Fries there.

Everyone likes food to be served hot, u don't need to remind that to your customer. Accept that you are of no good quality, there are plenty other good coffee shops in the town. We eat the food not the franchise. Iftar platter... had bland chicken hariyali kebab, fish fritters were way too much fried and cold, spicy grilled chicken with the friend rice was actually without any spice. I am sorry to say it was overall tasteless. Coleslaw with the chicken lemon oli was sour and inedible.

"Dear Gloria Jean's, would you mind taking a few minutes to explain what do you mean when you say to your customer that Gloria Jean's is a FAMILY Restaurant? And what do you mean when you say to your customer that there are CCTVs, so DO NOT SIT IN CLOSE CONTACTS? Why don't you put a notice or distribute pamphlet If you want your customer to follow such a CODE of CONDUCTS that is not against YOUR FAMILY VALUE? Do you think a boy and a girl go to Gloria Jean's to KISS EACH OTHER... in PUBLIC? How could it be against the FAMILY VALUE if two people sit together grabbing each other's hand? Do you think two people can get enough close that would look unusual in your arrangement?",1,,680,Negative

"Gloria Jean's Coffees Bangladesh- it's a coffee shop where coffee tastes horrible and other dishes taste quite well. They don't even concentrate on improving the taste of the Coffees. They are constantly trying to improve other dishes which are easily found in other ""restaurants"". I repeat ""Restaurants"". Last I checked Gloria jeans is not a restaurant, it's a coffee shop. My question is- Has Gloria jeans become a restaurant or is it still a coffee shop? You guys are selling... deserts, fried rice, burgers and many other things very efficiently and they taste quite good as well. But when it comes to your coffee, they taste like shit. I have been going there for a long time and it's unacceptable from a great coffee shop like this one. I have been going to various coffee shops for a long time and that's how I developed a keen taste for Coffees. I know the variations of Coffees and the taste of them. In other coffee shops, the variations of coffee is quite amazing. Here one day I ordered ""cafe mocha"" and it tasted as usual. The next time I went there, I ordered a ""cappuccino"". I couldn't even differentiate between those two because both of them tasted the same. There is no depth and aroma in these coffees. If I can't find the variations among the different types of Coffees, then why the hell anyone should come here to taste these horrible Coffees with such high prices? They certainly maintain a standard about other dishes and they taste really good. But as a coffee shop, they don't deserve to get a rating of 1.",1,,1532,Negative

The beef and chicken vegetable - are shamelessly small quantity and flooded with gravy to fill the plate. I have never seen such a Chinese dish with Indian curry like gravy and small portions . The manager might be trying to save money to have higher bonus . I believe any restaurant inspector will... reject this ( if there is a licensing authority -unfortunately there is none ) . Despite specifically requested for little or no chilies- the foods were served with red and green chilies and when complained they waived the price of ice cream (5 out of 10). I would spend my money some where else next time.",2,,788,Negative

Butter nan has no butter it dry and when you eat its sandy!! All the appetite will go seeing the glass they use for serving fresh juice.. Juice taste is not good either you can only taste rock salt! Price is too high which derives to disappointment. The only good thing was the Beef Achari that tastes better though beef pieces were supplemented by achar thus the name should be ""Achari Beef""..

We ordered 1 khichuri thali and one Naan thali and one chicken butter masala. ... 1) khichuri thali: shockingly there was a hair in khichuri! !! My pregnant sis was craving for your khichuri..we or...dered 2 hours before we reach tarka so that we can get the khichuri thali...and that's what she get??? Amazing! There was another time I got hair on my salad but I overlooked it..but today! !! Anyway. ..now the bhortas. ..whenever we ordered khichuri thali we got Taki machher bhorta. .. and today we got tasteless, flooded with mustard oil alu bhorta which we weren't informed before. .when my sis asked the waiter he gave a lame explanation that is 'amra ekekdin ekek bhorta dei' how come we never got any other bhorta!! Lameness er limit thake..if you ran out of food..you could inform us!!and the Kala bhuna...we requested that the last timewe orderedit was so hard that we could hardly eat..n today..it was just same!! UNEXPECTED 2) Naan thali: I ordered garlic Naan..they served plain Naan...when I complain they replaced it with garlic Naan..it it was hard and cold...though they heat it..it was hard...I don't know what happened to tarkas that Naan. ..which used to melt in mouth....everything in the thali was cold. ..daal was more like home made daal chorchori...n palak paneer. ..saltless. ..tasteless. ..it didn't even had the buttery texture it used to have....DISAPPOINTED 3)chicken butter masala : taste was good...but the ratio according to price is very very poor..I tried chicken butter masala before but I had no idea that your restaurant serves it with minced chicken.

After about ten minutes they came back with the pani puri. I finished my meal while my wife was still waiting for her beef roll which arrived even after the take away food was ready. To add to all this misery regarding the service, the food was horrible. Not worth the time, anxiety, or money. Not going back unless the entire serving staff is changed or trained properly. The chefs need some training as well.",1,,771,Negative

The overall taste was good but for 279tk, considering the toppings, it was overpriced. The making of pizza in an oven in front of you is the main attention.

And finally, takes 5 minutes to place an order...and then someone has to accept it from Umai...which nobody does. 10 minutes wasted lmao. 25% discount if order through app? But only for one item in cart! Ordered Chicken Karaage. Came without any Soy sauce. Dry af tiny crispy chicken without any taste. Next up Umai Special Creamy Salmon Roll and another Salmon Roll. Big in names; tiny in sizes. Yuuuge in prices. Have had these types of foods in many other places but yours are by far the worse in taste, size but super high on the price.

This was never the case. 2. I've ordered for Chicken Butter Masala. Once I reached home I came to disc...over that it tastes different. I didn't bother checking the receipt before I left because Lucknow has never failed to reach my expectations, but when I did, it was listed Chicken Tikka Masala. 3.

Hopefully Lucknow will keep his rivals in mind and improve their cuisines. I don't mind paying much but it's has to be worthwhile.",2,,407,Negative

They took reservation for sehri but when we went there (at 1:15 am) they simply said â€œwe are closedâ€. They didnâ€™t even bother to inform us regarding this cancellation. Most irresponsible restaurant service I have ever experienced. I wish I could rate them â€œzeroâ€ !,1,,272,Negative

"I visited few days back. The overall environment and decoration is very pale and sub-standard. The plastic chairs and dirty tables, unhygienic washroom and basin area ruined my taste for having food. Nevertheless, I ordered for their beef and mutton. Simply, taste was rubbish. The mutton was stale and just served after warming the mutton cooked the other day. Anyway, more was left for me. When wished to try their chicken, I was told that it was finished though it was 9 pm only. The brinjal fry was burnt and was not edible at all. The dal was simply as good as that served in a street shop. And finally, the rice was of such poor quality that I can't even imagine even to serve this quality rice to my domestic servant. OK, I tried their firni also and I don't wanna say any more. A total wastage of my money. Determined not to visit ever.",1,,844,Negative
Now the rating is like this because I wasn't able to have food here due to their lack of responsibility. I was planning to go to their Bashundhara branch for sehri and for that I did talk to them a few times to ensure they are open for sehri. Now after going there at 1 AM monday night(Tuesday 1am) I found them closed. When asked they replied they ran out of food that day just after the Iftar and that's why they are closed today. Very unprofessional and hugely disappointing. ... Couldn't you post a note saying that in your FB page!!! What the hell is wrong with you guys!!!,1,,578,Negative

"Worst Experience I have ever had. We almost waited for more than 1 hour only for 2 pasta. It was not well cooked. They don't maintain first order first serve basis. Who ordered after us they got their pasta but we didn't. When we asked that waited told us that 'age jeita Ber hoise sheita serve Kora hoise'. I think waiter should know how to provide service. Then they shout to their cook that 'jemon hoise Ber koro'. Every waiter and specially who wear glass should be more professionalism. Personally I won't go think that restaurant to go twice. I would recommend ""Cafe Appeliano"" which is very good in every way.",1,,616,Negative

"I hv been there several times.. It was one of my favorite place in Khilgaon. But I must say its quality is deteriorating day by day..

But do u realize the price it becomes?? Does it match with the food?? Today I had iftar there.. I m deeply disappointed with everything. I had Fried R...ice with three items.. It was the worst set meal I hv ever had. If i analyse it briefly i will say Food Quality- 2*, Quantity- 1* , Price-1* (300/-) (Excluding VAT). It becomes 345/- total (Without water, Soft drink) ..

"The worst Thai food ever! I went there five times to prove myself wrong, but the desi chef consistently served us worst possible food every time. First time I went with a friend and we tried a salad, rice noodle with prawn and finally a coconut ice cream. That was by far the acceptable ones, because we could at least finish eating. We have been fed with the lie that a Thai chef is working in the kitchen, whose big picture is proudly displayed at the entrance! From second time... onwards everything went wrong. Called the manager, who says he is looking into it and never returned. We asked the waiters who also disappeared and never came back. It is the third time we found out that their Thai chef has actually gone on leave two months ago, later found out he left four months ago. The current cook is a Bangladeshi who worked in Bangkok for many years. I am sure he never cooked Thai cuisine for Thai people. Probably worked sat ome desi restaurant in Bangkok cooking desi curries and bhartas! He is your so called â€œThaiâ€ chef currently preparing all the dishes singlehandedly. My God! Last time we went, we ordered a seafood soup in coconut milk and beef Panama curry. The soup was so sweet that we thought we are having coconut milk sherbet! The beef panang curry was also very sweet. My friend and I were so disappointed that we vouched that we will NEVER COME BACK to Absolute Thai. What an absolute cheating! Be aware!",1,,1433,Negative
"The worst Thai food i have ever had in my life, We order sea food soup, and pad Thai,, Sea food soup was really bad and dont ask about the pad Thai it was horrifying,, Noodels were overcooked, overloaded with sauce, too much sweet, and very raw egg kinda smell.. They told us their chef is from Thailand,... If a Thai chef couldn't cook pad Thai in a right way then who else does!? Maybe that's he couldn't rise up his career in Thailand ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and came to Bangladesh ï¿½ï¿½.. The waste of money but our pictures came out really well,, thats the only good thing about this restaurant.ï¿½ï¿½",1,,596,Negative
"Items were far less, not everything mentioned in the Iftar+Dinner buffet menu was there. When you are paying 1k++ for buffet and get only 18+ items to choose from you at least expect the taste to be spot on, but the food didn't taste good. They couldn't even get the fried rice rightï¿½. They claim to be an authentic Thai restaurant but their Pad Thai was the most disappointing dish out of all- It was noodle stirred in a handful of tomato ketchup and eggï¿½. Also, main and desse...rt items were finished by the time we were done with our appetizer and entree. And the most frustrating part of the dinner was the payment. In their facebook post, they mentioned if you pay through certain bank's card you will enjoy 20% discount. So, I decided to pay with my card, which belonged to one of their mentioned banks, but they gave me only 15% discount. When I let them know about their post, they demanded proof-which I showed them on my phone, but still they were firm and rigid on their claim.",1,,993,Negative
"The pad thai was basically boiled flat noodle tossed in sauce and scrambled eggs, no bean sprouts or any greens. The mango with sticky rice was horrible with the rice undercooked maybe because the rice was frozen before it was boiled or whatever. Coconut ice cream was ok but too sweet, the only thing good was the tom yam soup but really getting 1 out of 4 dishes taste right is just disappointing.",2,,399,Negative
"Itâ€™s been awhile since Iâ€™ve last been here. So, we decided to revisit. And man, how I regret it! The pad thai was so bad and so stinky that we decided to send it back. The only two things that were average was, the fried rice and the red chilli beef. Sea food green curry lacked the flavour and was smelly as well. Fishcake was to rubbery, chicken was basically an overdose of soya sauce. They had only one other table with a family of 5/6 along with us 4, yet my wife literally h...ad to shout â€œexcuse meâ€ to call out the waiter, at least 3/4 times. When I asked about if they had discount for credit cards, the waiter said no with a very straight face till I showed him that EBL signature cards are eligible for 15% discount on ala carte. He went to double check and agreed so. The only thing that probably stood out was they didnâ€™t charge us for the pad thai, which we sent back. Itâ€™s really sad to see a restaurant doing so good when they open and only in a matter of time everything deteriorates. Not going back unless they give me free tickets to Thailand!!!",1,,1075,Negative

"Went with a friend for dinner. totally starving after not having had anything to eat the entire day, after shopping. Decided to go for thai food. We arrive around 5ish pm today, there were only 2 tables occupied so of course we expected the service to be fast, but of course that was not the case at all. We ordered thai ice tea, tom yum soup, absolute thai platter, pineapple rice and pad thai. The ice tea too much milk, which ended up really sweet. Tom yum soup was utterly ...disappointing, too much coconut milk. The platter, the only ok, not even good, but ok in it was the fried prawns. The rest was obsolutely rubbish. Pineapple rice was not up to standard at all, the prawn was not fresh at all and the worst of them all which was not even edible and which probably made me and my friend sick was the pad thai, which seemed like it was a left over from yesterday. It had a smell. It was obsolutely rubbish. Worst thai experience i have had. We lost out appetite in the end. We only had a mouthful, paid and left. I felt sick and havent had anything to eat but a chocolate brownie from somewhere else hoping the taste would all be gone and my appetite will get back. But no, my appetite is completely lost. I wouldnt even give this a 1 star! Terrible experience and the service was terrible as well! There were a number of staffs with only 3 tables occupied, including ours however, we had to get up to get the bill as no one came when we called out for anyone! First and last time here. Not worth the time, the food and the money! Dont waste your money! Save the trip! Go somewhere else!",1,,1596,Negative

And Mango sticky rice - you never ever going to pay for this awful food. When we called the manager and asked whether you have changed your cook or not?

"Horrible service, substandard food, I'm never taking recommendations online ever again. I come in and the waiter asks me ""kar kacche ashcchen?"" What is that?

Also, the waiters keep hovering around like vultures the whole time as you eat.",1,,426,Negative
"Food was good... we ordered Prawn fried rice, seafood thai soup, beef with pepper and sweet and sour king prawns... apart from the rice (which was ordinary at best), everything else was good... Now the problems... the king prawns isn't really cheap, so one would expect equal sized prawns... but the restaurant does the same trick many other restaurants do, they give 2 actual king prawns and the other 2 is less than half the size.... our total for the food was 2200, which (if i...t was all inclusive) would have been perfect and amazing, and I'd have recommended it to my friends and would have visited again....however, the 15% VAT and 10% service charge took our total bill to closely BDT 3000... upon close calculation, we realised that the 3:1 rice which was 575 BDT would actually cost 718 including the ++ .... paying 718 Tk for 3 person rice feels ridiculous for even a 3 michellin star studded restaurant... similarly, water costs 65++ (BDT 80)... we went on a weekend and it was almost empty.... and I can understand why... despite the restaurant being really nice, not a lot of people would go there more than once... I hope the restaurant management realizes that and does something about it, because I'd love to go there again if the price becomes reasonable...",2,,1276,Negative

Never been this offended in my ...entire life. Restaurant is not about food it is also about the customer service.

"Absolute Crap. Almost walked out after having an excuse of a fish cake, 'mama piaju' would've fared better. Somehow restrained myself to give the rest of the foods a chance. But alas, none of the foods looked appetising to start with; the rice & noodle were too sweet & the curries were salty. I didn't quite get from which angle this was Thai cuisine apart from some Thai spices & vegetation randomly thrown in. And apparently the chef is Thai. Well, I can imagine he was probably found selling Thai mama piaju on the streets of Thailand. Worst Thai food experience.",1,,567,Negative

"Entered Spaghetti Jazz at roughly 2.45pm after calling them up to find out if they were open and where exactly the restaurant was. They asked us to order fast as they we gonna stop the kitchen operations at 3pm. We ordered 2 mushroom steaks. They were quick to serve the food. The grilled vegetables were good. Mashed potato was a little dry. Steak was dry and chewy. Mushrooms tasted bland. The waitress kept on hovering around us and handed the bill over to us not even halfway through the meal. She insisted we pay up the bill then mentioning that they were going to go on a break. At no point were the waiters/wiatresses cordial with us. Their attitude was outright impolite. We should have been notified on arrival that they were going to have a soft-close at 3 and wouldn't be able to serve us then. We would have been alright with that and left. Instead, they served us overcooked steaks and provided us the worst service I've experienced since 2013. To the Management: I am sorry but your steak was overpriced considering the quality and you really need to hire new staff. Alternatively you can also remove the service charge from your prices and make your employees work for the tip, who now get it regardless of how they treat your customers. The two stars I have given you is because of the grilled vegetables and the positive attitude of the guard with the beard; the only good things about our experience at SJ today. This is a very constructive criticism, please take note of it.",2,,1493,Negative

"Just within Two week they shows their real face actually they doing business now because frist time when we visit they served Shrimp BBQ in lunch but after two week when we visit again they didn't served and when I asked very easily they telling lie that they never served Shrimp BBQ in lunch. One more thing those people who serve BBQ they shows they too disturb to serve us more Two or Three time, is it a business policy? I want to say if you guys don't have ability to give proper service then why? Please do what you can, we spend our money to get better service . You guys have excellent and delicious food but with poorest service.",2,,638,Negative
"Cold skewered meat, bland food, worst mixed vegetables I've ever had (literally felt like I was chewing on wood chips soaked in gravy), dry pasta, something that they called fish (not sure what kind of fish was that, as a seafood lover and as someone who traveled to distant places for good fish, I felt offended by the fish dish). I'm not sure why people gave it such high ratings. Spent time with a lot of loved ones, that was the highlight of the visit, certainly not the food. Never going there again even if someone paid me to go there.",1,,541,Negative

Pretty much the worst steak house I have ever been to..... Steak tasted salty and the chef probably do not have any idea how to prime a steak.... Used spices on a steak... Yuck.... Felt like I had fried masala beef fry....,,FALSE,222,Negative
"Went there with high expectation. The appetiser was okay but the main dishes were pathetic. There was some smell coming out from the steak and didnâ€™t like the flavour at all. Also we complained about it to the manager and he gave us complementary desserts which also tasted smelly. The presentation was good, service was good but sadly the food taste was not up to the mark. It is an expensive food place so it is normal for customer like us to expect that high quality and value for money we are paying. Hope they will improve and give us the chance to say something good in the future!",1,,589,Negative
"Shawâ€™s Steakhouse in Dhaka is located in Gulshan 2, however is a major let down. First I wanted to go there for a dinner on the day before EID, since they had a promotion (discount plus free drink). I contacted the restaurant and confirmed that they are open. Unfortunately I went there then accordingly only to discover that the restaurant had closed already at 7.00 p.m. without prior notice. Nevertheless I agreed to give it a second try and went there once more today, only to... be even more disappointed. What I noticed immediately was that the restaurant was extremly empty, that though might have been to the early time of the day (7.45 p.m.). I would have loved to eat several of their items on the menu, but to my disappointment the majority of their items were unavailable. The issue started small, first one starter wasnâ€™t available and we asked for some more time to re-think alternatives. Shockingly the issue of them being out of items continued, for the next 7 (starters, salds, steaks, pasta dishes,â€¦ !!) items we wanted to order each time as an alternative. They each time said that the item would be unavailable or that they had run out of stock (for example Beef nachos was apparently already sold out). . but at 7.45 p.m. and only two other customers at the restaurant that seemed to be highly unlikely.. ironically enough they later tried to suggest that we take one of their more expensive platters which contained 4 of the items that they had told us before would be unavailable and rest only the most expensive items were available from the menu. It is evident to me that the restaurant which had a decent amount of potential is just being run-down and not properly managed and that must be the reason why there are no or hardly any customersâ€¦ (despite their social media presence being very professional).",,FALSE,1839,Negative
"Worst iftar cum dinner offer ever, went there with high expectations but was seriously disappointed by the food quality and specially the so called â€œsteakâ€. Is that what you call steak? Totally a deceiving place and severely overpriced",1,,238,Negative

It was our first visit. Service is very good. But when it comes to food it was utter disappointment. We asked for medium done steak. But it was literally raw with blood. They took it thrice for cooking it again. Price is on the higher side and alternatives are there. Didnâ€™t like the steak that much. You need to improve massively if u want to stay in competition.,1,,366,Negative

"Used to be one of my favorite restaurants. But today, when I visited there 9:40 pm they were lookin like they r watching some alien :3 then the guy who was sitting in cash counter he said now closing time. then he asked what I want to order I asked their 99tk package fried rice with vegetable and fried chicken including drinks.he told the offer is invalid then I order the regular price as he said available all of this.And their service is just awful. I saw a boy coming with ...a plate having rice and a small piece of chicken no salad and no chinese vegetable!!! I wondered when I asked why its like this he said that vegetables are not available. the worst thing is when I told that I bought a guest with me why u guys insulting me.The waiter told me to manage..Waiters don't have slightest concern for customers. They just move around they don't care at all and the person who took the order he was mad about to go home and when looking for him to answer he was not there already left.who was in cash he took full bill and even did not ask me anything.Awfully he asked extra money for drinks.I never imagined take a bite is giving this worst service now a days.

In the beginning home service was A class. No delivery charge as my home is near by and amount of food was adequate so was the quality. I have been ordering for quite some time now.

Now the quantity is twice lesser than before and time of delivery has gone up twice too! You were so good before!,2,,459,Negative

Not even a single molecule of cheese. Literally there was nothing that can resemble anything close to cheese. There were in total 3 microscopic pieces of chicken. Taste: 0/10...

Service 2/10: staffs were not friendly and they don't seem to care about the customers Food 3/10: ordered naga pasta and naga chow mein. The pasta was the worse pasta I've ever eaten and it didn't have no spice and it was nowhere near to be called naga pasta . Took it as parcel as it was tasteless. After going home it was a rotten as they surely served bashi pasta. Giving 3 star rating because chow mein was a bit up to the mark. Horrible experience.

"Went to Pasta State Dhanmondi to have unlimited Pasta.... I had buffet and Unlimited meals at least 30-40 times in the last few years but this wast the worst unlimited offer.... Here's a short review~ So when I was entering the restaurant a guy was going out , he came back 1 minute after that and complained that a cockroach came out from his Pizza Box ï¿½ I saw the cockroach too.... Kinda lost my appetite there... They probably changed his pizza after that. After that we were w...aiting and the electricity went off, The whole restaurant was for at least 15 minutes so I am guessing they don't have a generator. Finally they served the pastas 20 minutes before Iftar... it was looking good to be honest... So after azan we started eating and the next experience is horrible... There was only cheese top layer... they just mixed mayonnaise with some boiled pasta and topped it with a lil bit of cheese and served it... At least 1/5th part of the bowl was full of oil ï¿½ I ate 20 huges slices of pizza in another restaurant last week so eating 5/6 bowls or atleast 3 bowls of Pasta is nothing for me... My friend didn't even try another bowl... I went for a second one and they said they don't have any more bowls to serve the pastas so they started serving in take away containers.... Btw ALL of the plates and bowls were broken (the edges) I couldn't even finish the second one... so I requested a waiter to pack it up for me so I can give it to someone on the street since it's Ramadan we shouldn't waste food ï¿½ They packed it up.... Almost everyone took their pasta in parcel because they couldn't finish it... (though it was an unlimited offer) They are serving their ""Special Baked Pasta"" only with Coke/Sprite~ Price : 345tk (including everything) Taste : 2/10 ï¿½ Environment : 5/10 Service : 5/10 I won't even recommend my enemy to go and take this order ï¿½ Really disappointed~",1,,1894,Negative

"Worst service.. They had only three tables to cover.. They somehow managed that to look like a rush.. Took more than one hour to serve simple oven baked pasta which by the way was blunt and creamy. The chicken steak oregano tasted good but the quantity and the price don't match at all. Set menu was average with very unpleasant decoration.. But coming back to my first point, if you guys can't serve anything within a given time please do have the decency to accept it and tell us on the face. People who came late and ordered late got their foods served but others had to wait for no apparent reason ! Customers don't want 10% honour or whatsoever for your lousy service.. Never going back to your place and obviously not recommending it to others.. but then again with so many customers in your grasp a lousy review doesn't matter anyway.",2,,841,Negative

"During last Saturday, I had Iftar cum dinner buffet at Bunkers. So guys, I am reviewing on the basis of only this; do not relate this with any of their regular platters. I had only tasted what was offered in that buffet menu. THE WORST BUFFET EVER I EXPERIENCED !!!... I am not writing this on anger. I let myself cool down, waited for than two days and were thinking where that went wrong; now reviewing. 1. If a restaurant offers buffet, it should be only buffet. No other regular platter should be offered during that time span. That creates a mess. They were offering buffet with every other regular platters. Hence, there place wasn't well designed and stuffs were not properly trained to handle such mayhem. 2. They offered around 30 items and to refill one dish we had to wait like 10 to 15 minutes; standing in a line. If you don't have enough structural setup and expertise to handle a house full of guests, why you guys offer buffet? 3. There were shortage of food. Usually people have spring roll with soup. They were refilling soup but spring roll was vanished; literally vanish after first round. When I asked, they replied (à¦¶à§‡à¦· à¦¹à§Ÿà§‡ à¦—à§‡à¦¸à§‡ à¦­à¦¾à¦‡à§Ÿà¦¾, à¦¸à¦°à¦¿). What nonsense is that? Do you guys even know what buffet means? 4. And there was an item of chicken covered with sauce (I forgot the name). That was good. I could grab 3 pieces and yet again, never refilled. According to their menu, they should have an item of beef, haven't seen it. A guest from the next table said that they gave a new dish, spicy chicken; I went and an empty plate was there. I complained and probably the store manager said (à¦¸à§à¦¯à¦¾à¦°, à¦¦à¦¿à§Ÿà§‡ à¦¤à§‹ à¦•à§à¦²à¦¾à¦¤à§‡ à¦ªà¦¾à¦°à¦›à¦¿ à¦¨à¦¾, à¦¦à§‡à§Ÿà¦¾à¦° à¦¸à¦¾à¦¥à§‡ à¦¸à¦¾à¦¥à§‡à¦‡ à¦¶à§‡à¦· à¦¹à§Ÿà§‡ à¦¯à¦¾à¦šà§à¦›à§‡). Dear that person, let me apologize for my language, but are you stupid? Do the math. Count the number of ovens you have, number of cooks in there, stuffs you have, estimate your food preparation pace, understand how many guests you can handle and over buffet for 5 less than that number. If you cannot cope up with the pace even once, you should be really really sorry. 5. And, now comes the topic of mighty PIZZA. Pizza wasn't included in the buffet menu they showed me but they were offering it. WORLD'S THINNEST PIZZA, I MUST SAY! :P Everyone must go and have a look; really astonishing. 6. Buffet time was till 9PM and most of the dishes were vanished around 7.45PM. People were starting to leave and around 8PM I left with the worst buffet experience in my life.",1,,2576,Negative

"Last Friday we planned to dine out and headed to Pizza Hut at Dampara, Chittagong. We ordered for a large size cheesy bite pizza with chicken & other expected toppings, baked chicken pasta, fried button mushroom and cream of chicken soup. We were really shocked to find just a few tiny chunks of chicken as part of the toppings over the so-called pizza. Cream of chicken soup was also nothing special. By pouring little cream on a typical glutinous soup, you can't name it cream o...f chicken soup for your very kind information. Trust me, I had much better baked pasta at Da Signature in Chittagong and Shawarma House in Dhaka. Your baked pasta was awefully gravy when the cheese layer was taken off the top. Are you guys making money in Bangladesh by fooling innocent hard-working people down here? Are you ripping us off by using the brand ""Pizza Hut""?",1,,855,Negative
"I order almost 2-3 times a week from Pizza Hut PHD Dhanmondi. I order pizza all the time but unfortunately I ordered the chicken mushroom pasta today which happens to be the worst pasta I ever had. No trace of white sauce, the use of slightly roasted onions was so much that it made me wonder if the main ingredient was pasta or onion. You guys just packed me a box full of garbage! Picture in the comment section!",1,,414,Negative
One of the worst pizza i ever had in my life.Better you serve better food by increasing your price or better walk out from your business.Food is not always about price.Quality is important.,,FALSE,189,Negative
"Pizza hut is a international chain restaurant. But in Bangladesh I donâ€™t think itâ€™s official anymore, because the service, food and environment wasnâ€™t like that what it is used to be 5 years back. Me and my wife went last monday the waiter who took our order was stupid. Soup was cold and they are literally cleaning the sealing even people are eating. Well bla bla bla bla. Transcom company should shut it off.",1,,417,Negative
Seeking attention to the higher authority! Just been to baily road branch and the food was aweful. Specifically the topping and cheese were smelly on top of that waiter took my order wrong and over charged me so I complained and they kept me waiting while getting the numbers right. I left a complain feedback but I doubt whether it will reach to the higher authority ever. Disgraceful overall!,1,,394,Negative
"Good God! After enjoying meals in Pizza hut across the world all my life, I took my boy out during the school break for a treat. He ordered the ""special"" pizza... which turned out to be nothing remotely like what we're used to. Listen, seriously, I know this is Bangladesh and all and you're trying to cater to the native palate but **you don't have to**... pizza hut is now off our list of places (for me and my wife and my son - hat-trick - perfect) because of this monstrosity they served us. If I wanted a Bengali pizza from an American chain (on home ground), I'd head down to my local Habib Hotel and order their curry and rice. It was hideous. The product development team need to stick up a reminder on their desks, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"" Meanwhile, I shall be taking my wallet somewhere where I get a pizza when I order one.",1,,845,Negative
"I ordered pizza by Food panda. the worst ever i eat. this is iftre time guys. my family didn't told me anything. they send me two pizza. it was buy 1 get 1 free offer. but there is no cheese (what we expected). bread was too much dry. after the iftar, in night i baked extra slice in oven and what??? it looks same as a ""pauruti"" with some onion :( ...sorry pizza hut. please do something good, because you have good reputation in pizza. :( sorry for poor rating.",1,,463,Negative
"To the authority, I have been a dedicated customer of Pizza Hut for more than 5 years. Your pizzas and service has always intrigued me. However, recently I have seen you charge high ""exclusive"" VAT and Tax rates for the products. For example, you are charging VAT and Tax for buying soft drinks from your outlets at high rates (BDT132/- VAT+Appl SD for Cheese Lovers and one Mirinda worth BDT 548/- total). Another case: BDT 104/- VAT+Appl SD for a meal worth BDT 699/- I want to know the reason behind this increase.

"I used to be very regular at Pizza hut. Recently I had been to pizza hut, gulshan outlet. The service and food quality had been degraded so much I had no idea. I used to keep on calling for attendees, keep asking for services but it took a lot of time to seek their attention. For payment they took my card and no one returned it back. I had to rush to other waiters to find out my cards. Then managers had to come to sort out problems. I had never faced such service. Very heartbroken with the carelessness. Also the taste of food changed drastically. I really don't know is there any reason left I will ever visit there. very much disappointing.",,FALSE,647,Negative

Today I tried the chicken arrabbiata pasta from your Bashundhara outlet. The pasta was absolutely disgusting! I know it is not right to criticize food this way but the food you served tasted so bad.

I need a lower star rating to rate this place. When pizza hut came to bangladesh it was simply the place to be.

"I wish I could rate them -0! To. Be honest they don't deserve that! I used to think Pizza Hut is an outstanding food chain but they proved me wrong! Called them nearly 8:35 pm for placing an order , 1st receiver told me to call after 9:00 pm as they can't TAKE order then! Who does that? Anyways, next Time I called, they told me that they can't delivery to Jigatola. Was surprised! I told him that I ordered from my present address before. He said it's impossible to deliver to... my address and hung up! After today's experience I was feeling like showering the Pizza Hut delivery management team with all the galis I know:) On which basis Pizza Hut recruits those bloody idiots who don't even know how to serve their customer? How to talk to them? Never expected this, Pizza Hut can be so damn unprofessional!!!!!!!!!! If you can't deliver to a certain area you must announce that! Never ever going to place an order from them .",1,,931,Negative

Currently no one knows the actual status of its international franchisee license and clearly they don't care about the quality of food anymore. There used to be a time when this was country's only place for pizza and pasta. As many good competitors have risen up now, you don't have to eat the DRY, RUBBERY pasta, and TASTELESS, generic pizza they serve, not anymore.

Manager challenged us at the time of bill... and didnt learn how to deal/talk to customers/guests- we had a guest below 10 years who is supposed to get 50% billed but Manager claims she is around 12 years old.

Yesterday we had lunch over there. There were some other programs going on. They use bamboo with cloth to separate space. Food wasn't upto the mark. Dessert items are less than expected. No air conditions were working. After forth complaints they sent a person to fix it but nothing happened. Most places they set up GFC fans. This place is totally a bullshit. I suggest not to go there..,1,,388,Negative

"I used to like visiting this cafe but yesterday's experience has made me determined never to visit the place again. I was there with friends and each time my friends wanted to order something, the waiter countered asking them to order someone else. For example, a friend ordered Thai chicken, and the waiter said to order grilled chicken. Another friend ordered chicken pizza and the waiter said to order seafood pizza. These are just 2 examples. The entire fiasco went for more than 15 minutes. And the waiter wasn't even suggesting alternatives. He was blatantly saying, no try the other one. I was extremely pissed with the service and never going back there again.",1,,668,Negative

"Our experience was pretty bad. They seemed new. Most of the foods in their menu were unavailable. They even gave excuses like ""our fridges were down, so we can't prepare the milkshakes"". The staffs took order from us 5 times as anything we ordered was unavailable, as they went on asking the chefs I think. Finally we managed to order something. Then they kept us waiting for too long time. They even forgot half of our order. Also we ordered wrapped swarma and they claimed we ordered arabian swarma. This type of hazardous experience we had. Quality and quantity does not meet up to the pricing. Food is very much over priced. Moreover place is cozy and uncomfortable. They were not professional at all.

First review: Better than Pizza Roma ... would have given 5* if the crust were thinner and crunchy ! Revised review: ordered Pizza Salvatone which had few sprinkled strips of steaks unlike the picture shown in the menu.

He took away the dish right then and came back with explanation - ""the chef went out ...of the kitchen so the other person in charge prepared the dish and he forgot that he didn't warm it."" We are paying this price to have refrigerated food??? The manager came to say sorry n served us complementary brownie but how can it replace the fact that they serve cold food from the refrigerator.

"Was extremely disappointed with the service yesterday. We went there for brunch and waited for nearly 1.5 hours and yet the food was not served.

"I made a reservation for four at 2:30 pm yesterday. I was there on time, however, my friends had reached a few minutes prior to 3:00 pm. Before they could make themselves comfortable, a waiter insisted that we order at once, since apparently their kitchen closes at 3:00 pm. We did, and waited for 40 minutes (which they asked from us) for our food. Immediately after we finished, our waiter had gotten us the bill before we even asked, and said that they were to have a staff pa...rty- an implication that we leave. The food was good, but not out of the world. Therefore, from such a high-end restaurant, service at-least is well desired from a customer's end. Provided the place would be overcrowded (or even close to being crowded) on the occasion of Pohela Boishakh, I would have understood. I'm afraid that many other reviews well portray how they tend to serve their customers.",2,,883,Negative

"Going through your Facebook page, nowhere does it say that you have to make prior reservations. My husband and I went to Chows on Friday night, and we were literally turned out because we had no reservations! I see from one of your reviews that another customer had the same complaint. This level of customer service is unacceptable! As a regular food connoisseur, I'd suggest that you teach your staff customer relations because no amount of glitz and glamour will get you loyal customers if your restaurant has abominable customer service!!!",1,,543,Negative
I made a reservation at Chows and went their with my foreign guests. Went I called them to reserve a table they told me that the last order was at 3pm however they will consider my foreign guests and still serve us lunch after hours. When I went there with my guests they literally shut the door on our face and refused us to enter the restaurant. They should have never accepted our reservation if they were unable to serve. They don't have basic human decency. I even told them ...that my Chinese guests would just like to look around even if they cant serve us lunch. Still they shut the door on our faces. How can they be so rude to customers when they will have no business without us. I sincerely advice them to learn how to operate a restaurant and teach their staff basic manners.

Went there for lunch today: Environment is so so. Sitting arrangement as well as sits are not comfortable at all. Don't know who are their target customers. Ordered set menu 2 for four. Food was ok type. But prawn pad thai was the worst. It was crap. The chef/cook has basic problem of cooking process of Pad Thai. He needs trainig. Initially pad thai (rice noodles) was boiled in less amount of water. So it's got sticky. And not stir-fried. In addition amount of fried rice was not good enough for 4 person.

Packed everything else but the sushi. Really disgusting to think that they either ate it or they were going to serve it to the next customer. Really appalling Tokyo Express.",1,,574,Negative

"Worst ever experience of dining out at Tokyo Express in Gulshan! With high expectations I took my daughters to have dinner tonight there.I wish I never had gone there . I have tried almost all of the renowned restaurants in Dhaka but this was a nightmare.The service is horribly bad, food came late beyond one can expect Finally when it came, the main dish we crazed for never arrived. We just waited to see what was happening.It wasn't served till the last! Amazingly when the bi...ll came, we were charged also for the dish we never had. The person serving was most inexperienced, ill mannered & paid no attention to our needs. We don't eat free, we pay a lot of money for eating out. I will also complain to the CAB for such managements! The owners of Tokyo express should be more careful in providing services to their customers . I shall never ever go to this place and would highly recommend everyone to think not twice but many many times before going to this restaurant. I had terrible experience tonight ! Thanks to Tokyo express!!!!!",1,,1043,Negative

"Tokyo has been one of my very very few favorite places from the time they started but what i have tasted recently has left me utterly disappointed. Firstly the rice, tokyo's fried rice tasted amazing itself but the rice tastes like ""norom bhaat"" i even found few ""shada bhaat er dola"" did you change the rice or something because the rice tastes plain disgusting now! second, the spicy osaka beef tastes rubbery and seems like the only thing used to cook the beef was soy sauce and nothing else. The nanban doesnt even taste the same. the jumbo prawn tempura was the only saving grace! i really hope the management looks into this! this is extremely disheartening for a loyal customer of yours such as me.",2,,705,Negative

The ramen (not really but let's call it the name it was given by the restaurant) came last even though we asked for it first. Also poor choice in music (over remixed pop; c'mon it's 2017), trying to compensate for it by turning it to a deafening amount of loudness. Poor service overall. It's cold in here. I won't recommend coming here but if you do, bring a jacket or a shawl. MOSQUITOS EVERYWHERE. I MEAN EVERYWHERE.

This is the first time I visited Tokyo Express and I ordered Sumo Wrestler's Ramen and they served me my dish with hair in it. I really don't think they are capable enough to run the restaurant.

The staff member who talked to me had confirmed and assured me that the reservation was placed. At 2:15 AM when we actually arrived at the restaurant, we got to know that this reservation was never communicated to the sehri shift staff member. Kudos to them for their great professionalism :) But this was only the start. They served us the first plate at 3:27 AM, a mere 11 minutes before the sehri deadline. We waited for more than an hour thinking that okay they didn't communicate the reservation among themselves but surely a franchise like Sbarro will be able to serve up some platters in 30- 40 minutes. We were dead wrong. Even after taking such a long time, they didn't serve the full platter. Barely half of the offerings were plated in front of us. Sadly, all these things weren't the most pathetic part of the experience. This sham of a restaurant they are running didn't even have spoons! Yes, a restaurant without spoons. We had rush-eat rice with a fork and a knife. With 11minutes till the sehri deadline.",1,,1159,Negative

Kudos to them for their great professionalism :) But this was only the start. They served us the first plate at 3:27 AM, a mere 11 minutes before the sehri deadline. We waited for more than an hour thinking that okay they didn't communicate the reservation among themselves but surely a franchise like Sbarro will be able to serve up some platters in 30- 40 minutes. We were dead wrong. Even after taking such a long time, they didn't serve the full platter. Barely half of the offerings were plated in front of us. Sadly, all these things weren't the most pathetic part of the experience. This sham of a restaurant they are running didn't even have spoons! Yes, a restaurant without spoons.

Lots of people were still going inside because they had reserved their seats and I just stood there surprised that they denied taking reservations earlier today and lo and behold they actually did take reservations. In the end me and my siblings had to dine elsewhere. This kind of confusing service is extremely disappointing, especially coming from Sbarro which is widely lauded to have amazing service.

"They make the strongest crusts in town. I mean you can literally hurt people with the slices of pizzas, they are so hard!!! The layer of cheese is so thin that it can easily beat Megan Fox's hip. On the positive side, The slices were colder than their AC for sure. Chilling experience in a hot weather!!! You can also eat the slices upside down. ... Don't worry, the toppings are glued, so they won't fall off. What a trick to impress your girlfriend!!! Ofcourse, if you have one. A slice of cold, hard, ruti with little less harder toppings. Even the garlic mushroom had too much garlic!!! Pepsi was literally the best thing on your menu!!! On a serious note, if you are charging 220+vat for a slice, i expect quality!!!

"We 5 friends tried The latest offer of Buy 1 get 1 free, we also wanted to order other items. But they only had the â€œThai fried rice with chicken fry oneâ€, nothing else.

The fried chicken size was 1/3 of the given picture ones. The sizzling had hardly any chicken but full of carrots. Imagine caram... They took order of 5 cold drinks but served 4, when we asked the reason they said they ran out of cold drinks. Even they didnâ€™t have mineral water as well. Later on request they brought us a 500 ml bottle from downstairs. Now tell me in what kind of restaurants they ran out of drinking water??? It was a mistake of going after in such offers.

"I have always been a big fan of North End, but had a terrible experience today. Well, the coffee was very good as usual but the desperate effort of the staffs to close at 11 pm felt a bit weird and extremely uncomfortable. I went to North End at Cityscape tower with my Wife and Brother in law at around 10:30 pm. By that time they have already rounded up all the chairs and tables, which itself is not right if the official closing time is 11 pm. We ordered 4 cappuccino and were... waiting for our Sister to arrive.When she arrived at 11:00 pm they had already closed the sliding door. One of the staffs stopped her outside when she said my coffee has been ordered and they are waiting inside, which can be seen through the glass. The staffs kept arguing with her and given that the sliding door has already been turned off she got hurt hitting the glass door. This is sad as you feel unwelcome in a reputed coffee boutique. I personally feel this is what happens when you leave everything on the staffs. Quite a bad experience!",1,,1030,Negative

I am never ordering through Pizza Inn home delivery service ever again! Anyone who is reading this review if you are thinking of ordering pizza for home delivery in Dhanmondi, just don't do it!

"So I have been a customer of Pizza Inn since it started in Dhaka with their own building in Gulshan,Dhaka. I really liked eating pizza here. But what yesterday happened what just really disappointing. Look people make mistakes. I know that. I saw mistakes in Pizzas since day one. But you people improved. Then you reached the top of pizza chain (atleast to me). But yesterday's service just dragged you down to the last. So like any other day, I went with my family to eat ...pizza around 7 p.m. I sat at my usual place in second floor. Then there was this offer going on where you buy 1 large pizza and get another one absolutely free. So i ordered this BBQ Chicken classic pizza with the another one Pizza Inn Special which costed more. So obviously they took the second one as my order and the first one as the free one. It took them about 20 mins which is usual. They first gave the pizza inn special pizza. No fork or knives were in the table. They never offered one too. Then after I asked, they gave them. The waiter also had lack of knowledge about service (It was not his fault btw because he wasn't trained well. And i even tipped him well because he was really young) Then there came my usual and most favourite flavour BBQ. But it was really disappointing when i tasted the second one (BBQ). It tasted exactly like the first was. It was extremely disappointing to eat two pizzas with the same flavour even i ordered two different ones. I asked the waiter about that but he said he didn't know. I hope you review you your mistakes because I myself never expected this kind of service. My family also got disappointed which made me feel sad because I was the one to force them to eat here whilst they wanted to eat elsewhere....",1,,1739,Negative

"A story of disappointment and deception -_- Poorest food, price and service I have ever experienced! I am totally shocked at your response to the queries of the customers. It took about 40 minutes to deliver pizzas. Almost all the items are overpriced. The pasta I ordered was not worth 475 taka at all. Also, it was almost chilled, didn't look like you cooked it after I ordered. The waiter was always confused to our questions. You put the different columns for pizzas and crusts, well fine. But why there were no thin crusts which we ordered? Your worthless waiter was insisting us to order the high priced ones! That's how the pizza wich was shown taka 660 or something turned into 990 taka! Cunning policy, indeed. Totally disappointed at your work. Never coming again.",1,,774,Negative
"First of all they are not worthy enough to give even one star but since this is the minimum rating, I am giving one. Their delivery is very time consuming and on top of that they more or less forced us to take their stuffed crust which is of BDT 295. They have thin crush which they don't charge extra money for but that was not available. So it clearly proves that they are taking extra money for their so called stuffed crust forcefully! Now a days customers are willing to spend extra money on good food so you don't have to steal it from us showing lame excuses. If that is your business strategy then I suggest you to develop your business skills along with your pizza taste! They wrote BDT 600++ for their medium sized pizza but they took 990 instead because of stuffed crust which is so not worth the money!",1,,814,Negative

When we asked for a discount for the horrible service, they said they would give a discount but the delivery man asked for the whole bill.

Don't even place tissue on the table: went there with 3 people. And they place just four tissues under forks and knives. and that's it. You want more tissue, they'll listen and will be gone.

Pizza inn shouldn't introduce such offer where they cant maintain the minimum standard. This has been my favourite pizza shop in town always even in such offer time.

"I went to your Uttara outlet to avail the ""FNF Offer"" today around 09:00PM. Before going there, i checked your website and decided to order One Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza Large & One Deep Dish Pizza Large.

He also told me ""Deep Dish Pizza is very EXPENSIVE. It will cost around TK.1800."" Now my questions are: 1. If there is no such Pizza of Pizza Inn named Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza Large, then why you are displaying in your website? 2. If I have checked your website, then I am certain about the prices of the Products. Do you tell your customers that ""Sir, this Pizza is expensive. Don't take this one? Later I ordered BBQ Chicken Classic Large & Meaty Max Pizza Large. This is not the first time I am getting this kind of customer service from your Uttara Branch.

So i didn't like the pizza at all. The french fries was good btw. But the drumsticks was so tasteless that i couldn't eat them all.... They were loaded with so much masalas that i couldn't find the actual taste of it also. I didn't like that one also. Lastly comes the apple juice. I couldn't understand whether it was apple juice or not. Because bad smell was coming from that juice. So i didn't have that one also. Not going to come here anymore. Waste of money!!!!!

the one star is for the ambience and the lamb chops in the buffet. all the other items were pretty bad and they sucked. really SUCKED! To be honest its not worth tk.3500 that they are charging per person. who the hell gives papaya and tomato inside a crepe? its really sad when hotels like this provide food like baton rouge! money wasted. please hire some good chefs,1,,367,Negative
Very bad service... That's all I can say... And heavily charged.,1,,64,Negative
"Expanding business from Gulshan and Banani to Dhanmondi was a bad move for Pizza Roma basically cause it meant their quality being degraded. A stale pizza diavola with a hard crust and chewy dough was delivered with no sauces or chili flakes, especially when extra sauces was an added request.

The food was good enough. biriyanis tasted quite near delicious. taste - 9/10 But service!!!!! OMFG!!!!! I have never felt so miserable. went there with some of my friends and a elder brother. They treated us like SHIT. let me give you an example. we had to wait for 10 minutes for a bowl of daal only. they kept forgetting the orders. 1st of all they gave us only 3 glasses. But we were 7/8 sitting in the table. when we asked for more glass they gave us dirty glasses and that also after waiting for 5 minutes. And when we asked for the manager they didn't even pay any attention. Even though we were sitting just before the cash counter.

"My first review consisted of 5 stars but today, I am bound to revise my review & mark it with 1 star. I am incredibly annoyed with the quantity & the quality of the food items which they provided from their Dhanmondi branch. I ordered online through pathao food. I ordered their platter, R2, & it seemed to me that I paid 2500+ taka for a mere box of French fries!!! I had the same platter twice, before, but they have seemingly deteriorated the quality & lowered the quantity of ...their food items. Probably, they re-use the oil in which they fry their items. There was a distinct smell of used oil. The fish fingers were unbelievably thin & small. I just could see French fries throughout the box & the calamaries & shrimps were very few in numbers. In Ramadan too, I experienced the same thing. I had enough of Manhattan Fish Market. Never ever going back there or ordering food online from them. They literally have lost a regular customer.",1,,945,Negative

"Yesterday's azan was at 6.46 PM. The restaurant had served tang and iced tea beforehand. After the azan, everyone around us had food, except 3 tables. I figured they'd be 4/5 mins late. But nope, we waited there till 7.05 PM and got no food, while there was a table of around 15 people who'd received their second servings by that time. One time, a waiter came to our table with food, we got really excited because we'd been somewhat fasting for an extra 15 minutes, but then the ...waiter went back because that food wasn't for our table; such a tease, innit. At around 7 PM while everyone there was eating their fish and chips and we were sitting with our glass of iced tea, they brought us some really unappetizing, complementary soup. I lost it at that point and asked why they are seating people if they can't make enough food. To which they replied ""Amra chai na kono customer mon kharap koruk."" Bro you aren't serving people food for iftar, I think that's enough for me to ""mon kharap."" So then we left the place, as soon as we get on the lift they say ""Apnader food chole ashche."" As if I'm ever going back. We went to BFC and had super wholesome fried chicken. No ragrets, but f u, The Manhattan FISH MARKET Bangladesh. There was more weird shit before this, of course. I'd asked on Facebook whether or not the restaurant takes reservations, and they'd replied that they don't have any booking system in their outlets. They said that they serve people on a ""first come, first serve"" basis so it'd be best if we show up at least 45 minutes before iftar. I called the number given on your Facebook page and website again today at around 3 pm to check if you really don't take bookings. The cellphone was switched off. So we went to the Dhanmondi outlet at 5 PM today, and they told us they couldn't seat two people because all seats were booked. I told them that whoever manages their social media doesn't know that they take bookings, and if I show up at 5 at a virtually empty restaurant that serves iftar ""first come, first get,"" then I should get a table. Then they found us a table, lol. They took our order for an iftar platter at around 6 pm. After 15 minutes or so, they came to confirm it, and their receipt had the items ""garlic mussels, water"" whereas we'd ordered fish and chips and chicken tenders. We told them that they'd taken a completely wrong order for some reason. I mean, I'd understand if they'd thought we ordered grilled fish instead of fried, but mussels???? What??? But then we got no food at all because MUSSELS KHAIBI NA TOH MANHATTAN FISH MARKET AISOS KEN",1,,2591,Negative
This was my first visit to MFM and my experience was awful. I ordered chicken mussels calamari and for drinks I ordered sunset by the bay and lemongrass cooler. The drinks were so disgusting that we both could not take the second sip of those. The drinks were smelling like cockroach and cough syrup and the chicken was smelly too. The spice in the mussels was not good at all. The only good thing was the fries. I would not recommend this place for anything. We ordered coleslaw which was not served and thank God for that. We had some issues with the bill as well. They should improve the sincerity to their customers.,1,,620,Negative

"Last food experience was horrible! I was craving for chicken cashew nut salad & thus ordered this from them, along with a set menu via Hungrynaki. The cashew nut salad which they provide with their set menu is completely different from that of the individual dish. I haven't, in my whole, tasted such disgusting chicken cashew nut salad. It smells like beguni & pakora. They fry extemely thin & mini slices of chicken,(almost invisible), by covering them up with a huge amount of ...besan & flour which is responsible for this weird smell. There was abnormal thick coating in each of the chicken slices. The cashew nut salad which they provide with the set menu atleast contains capicum slices but the individual dish contains onions & cucumber only! Horrible...horrible experience. My craving was being killed by their food & I literally threw it away. They should & must stop cheating people by coating up their meat pieces with unnecessary amount of besan & flour to make them look bigger. I had the same experience with one of their beef items. The quality of their wrapped prawns has deteriorated too. There is too much of noodles & the prawns are incredibly thin & small. & the dish is too try but previously their wrapped prawns were juicy.

Hello ! Im from banasree and kind of a frequent customer of baba rafi branch . Last couple of times i had a common problem in this branch. They are not willing to take order as per my choice from the given menu but i had to take the foods what they want due to their manpower or some other reason. Today also the same thing happened . There is a new menu launched Chicken quesadilla and i wanted to order but they are not taking this order as it will take time and i agreed to wait but still they wont coz its not easy for them to make ! My question is why you keep such item on menu when you are not taking the order and have to order as u want when u have a menu?? This is not common for other branch of baba rafi . I want management to look into this and take needed action on this .thanks .,2,,794,Negative

You smell the 'ghee' from the far distance and keep wondering the food/ kabob must be good here! Sorry to break the news fellas. It's all about the dirty marketing strategies. They spread layers of ghee near the exhaust pipe and beautiful aroma is all around the restaurant. But the first bite of kabob is just enough to determine how horrible and low quality food they serve. Sure the food is cheap but taste matters! Avoid this restaurant altogether!!,1,,453,Negative

I ordered food using Pathao app. The restaurant calls me and say that price have changed and I have to pay about 250 taka more per items that I ordered. According to them the price did not get updated even though had changed the menu price. I agreed since didn't have much time to order again. Now the rib eye steaks that I ordered cost me 850 each. I received the items on time. The meat was not at all juicy and was so hard that I started to feel fatigue and pain i n my hand to cut. I couldn't finish it neither could my father. The price is excessively high and then you get something like this. I would have walked out if I was served it in the restaurant. The only thing that was good was the mashed potato tasted good.,1,,725,Negative

"This place was a bad experience. The food was bad, the cold drinks tasted like it had water in them and the bottles were dirty, there was no electricity the whole time we were there. The electricity thing might have not been totally their fault but if they are running a restaurant business then they need to make arrangement for electricity generators for this kind of situation. U canâ€™t just have one fan. It was suffocating. Horrible place............",1,,456,Negative

"1. Awful service. No one greeted or showed us where to sit. One of the waiters failed to fetch us a bottle of water. 2. The food is at best mediocre for the price. They are charging premium price. The service and the quality of the food should really be up to the mark. I'd be happy to change this review if they manage to improve. When you say ""from the founders of Tokyo Express"", it really is hard to cut them some slack.",1,,424,Negative
