"Great decoration, good service but when it comes to food it could be a lot better. Took the Jamaican chicken. It was a little too sweet for me. I took rice as a side and it was burned. When confronted they replied that it was supposed to have a smoky flavor!!!! I don't know what they meant!!! Anyways the chicken was well cooked, the Mocha according to my friend was also good. Rice was regular vegetable fried rice, nothing special. I have had better fried rice at street carts.... Seemed pretty expensive compared to the quality of food they serve. Good place to hangout with friends and family though. Cheers!!! ***Went their a week or two ago.",3,,648,Positive

Enough nd healthy food for quick lunch nd u can drained it with a juice or drink.

Very good interior decoration. good staff and services. Foods have different taste: Jamaican BBQ is really tasty though the Original BBQ is ok. Cream of mushroom is served in a round shaped bread; very tasty and has different looks. All other food are also well garnished and good in taste. Price is high. Front of the restaurant looks like a garage.,4,,350,Positive
Simply it was really Good day With Good Food ....ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½,4,,70,Positive
Food very nice. They must concentrate more on their service during bit rush hours in areas like: 1. Serving glass when guests come. I had to call the waiter many times for water glasses. Upon calling they did their job. 2. Green salad portion can be increased a bit in quatity as per price.... 3. For a birthday celebration as booked earlier they should have arranged a small cake. All in all its good. Above points are just some personal comments.,4,,448,Positive

"one of the best bbq, grills in town...love their their sehri / iftar meals... their food seem fresh... although I'd like to see a lil improvement on their mashed potatoe. it's a bit on the runny side... it's taste more like porridge than mashed potatoe, which should be a bit thick and dense... other than that, its worth it. i love their Jamaican and korean bbq meals ï¿½",4,,372,Positive
Due to too much of pressure for the Iftar maybe the quality wasn't up to the mark at all. Prome fritte was too bad. Otherwise it was always pleasant to go BBQ.,3,,159,Positive

Well it is indeed one of my favourite restaurants in Dhaka because of the super tasty chicken and mushroom cream soup. But if I mention about the valentine platter particularly it was not really up to the mark! As it it suppose to be for two people but the rice given is not really enough for two people. Then there's this unnecessary ï¿½ shaped sandwich! But yes if you talk about the chickens & the pricing comparing to other chicken platters then it was good to go!,4,,468,Positive
Overall good place with quality food...we'll go againï¿½ï¿½,5,,59,Positive

I recently went to the Dhanmondi branch and it was quite a let down compared to Gushan 2 branch.

Food was okay but a bit overpriced though. Service was good apart from the guy took the order was advising us what to order and pushing us a bit even though we never asked him for his valuable advice. Hence 3*.,3,,210,Positive
"I love this place. The Korean charbroiled chicken is to die for. I have been here a lot of times and I have never been disappointed until the last time. I was served cold food, even the mushroom soup was barely warm. And something is wrong with your mashed potato, it is usually so yummy (in Gulshan branch) but in my last two visits in dhanmondi branch I was disappointed with it too (may be the chef here is not getting the recipe right) Anyway, I really hope you guys were just having a bad day, but please make sure this doesn't happen again...COLD food is just not acceptable. I look forward to visit you many more times, please don't ruin the place for me. Thank you",5,,672,Positive

After I get back home I found that all the fried chicken is not given along with the other foods. But I paid for it.

"Have tried their Signature Biriyani, and the Hydrabadi Biriyani too. Signature one tastes great, but I didn't like the hydrabadi one. Mutton of the biriyani was not well cooked, and I could get the raw smell of meat from that one. But the Signature one is a must try. Also their hospitality was A class, all of their staffs are well mannered. Also the interior is pretty much impressive. Price might seem a bit high comparing to others those serving traditional Indian food, but the quantity is well enough. They say the Indian dishes are single serving, but it seemed a bit much for a person to me. Next time I want to try their Chinese cuisine. Hope it will not be a disappointing one. P.S. Though15% service charge and VAT was not included with the price in their menu, for some reason it was not charged to me.",4,,814,Positive

Reason: I always liked your food because it was a different chinese. Hot & spicy. But today, (I visited you almost after an year) i didnâ€™t get that spicy chinese.(specially the Mongolian beef). We can have Chinese in many other restaurants. But the taste you provided was incomparable to us. However, the food was good and the service was too good as always.",5,,513,Positive

Hakka- fusion of indian and chinese cuisine... And perhaps hakka dhaka is the most famous for serving hakka cuisine.... Orders their seafood platter and platter B... Wrapped prawn was certainly their blockbuster item and wantons played the Xavi role.... rice was decent but hakka noodles were bullshit... those were like noodles sold on carts! bbq crab should win the ballon d' or while steamed fish was may be the neymar of the platter! squid seemed to be paul pogba- overrated... chicken cashewnut was very good so the Szechuan prawns!!!,4,,539,Positive
"Yesterday we had the Happy Meal for Tk 499 and it was a very satisfying lunch. The spicy taste is what I liked most and the quantity was sufficient. The kulfi was excellent. We also ordered the Seafood Platter for 4 for takeaway. When we sat down to eat we found there wasn't enough food for all 4 of us. The fried rice, noodles, wrapped prawns and whole baked fish was sufficient but there wasn't enough crab and squid. After I called and complained to the Manager, he sent complementary dishes of each.

"Me and some of my friends had iftar here yesterday. First, I called up Hakka Dhaka Banani to make a reservation and they didn't answer my phone 5 times until someone picked up and hung up on me before I could even hear them! Then they started declining my calls after I called them again! (How rude!) I called them again with my home telephone line... And someone finally picked up and took the reservation. Unfortunately, all the tables inside were reserved and we had to sit ...outside. It's not that special outside... doesn't have a nice view or anything... just a bunch of plants to block the horrid view. And the people that usually sit there are smokers who have their iftar with a cigarette. My main problem was the noise outside. Cars were honking outside and it ruined the entire experience. My suggestion is that they should just convert that place into an indoor area. The food was alright... But a bit overpriced. The Ramadan platter was 4K for 4 people. I think for that amount, they could've thrown in some extra dishes. The noodles was just average... Everyone kept saying it was ""cocola noodles"" I hope they take notes and improve.",3,,1148,Positive

This was my first time yesterday. Starters were great. The main course was dissapointing really for the set platter....chicken was in the refrigerator for too long.....the noodle wrapped prawn (the one I wanted to taste) was bland.... (can spice up the prawn a bit).The prawn veggie was good and so was the beef. Most dissapointing thing was that they don't keep soft drinks at normal temperature (wierd)....come on there are children!! The best thing about the restaurant are the waiters who are helpful but a bit helpless given the circumstances!!!,3,,550,Positive

"Went there with family of 7 adults and 3 kids with out reservation. Before visiting I confirmed about reservation and they confirmed, it's not required. In the evening, specially on weekends, it's pretty crowded. Very friendly and helpful stuffs. Ordered 2 jumbo platter and some additional from menu. Noddle wrapped shrimp and honey barbecued chicken wings were great appetizer. Wonton and dumplings were also very tasty. ... Noddles and Mongolian chili beef are a bit spicy, not for kids. In general, food was really good. Jumbo platter for 4 is more than enough for 4 for sure. Service: 9/10 Food: 9/10 Ambiance: 7/10 Price: 8/10 Shall I visit again? DEFINITELY.",4,,665,Positive

Food is awesome.. truly delicious! A Heaven for people who love hot n spicy Chinese food! Service is not up to the mark. AC does not work well. Restaurant stuffs delay in serving food specially when we order Platter items. They serve some of the main items after serving the starters of a platter so lengthy that the customers finish having starters when they still keep bringing some 1 or 2 items which makes difficult for the customers to complete whole meal! Doesn't makes sense!!! Stuffs need to be trained about time management well to make dining meaningful!!!,3,,566,Positive

"The Hakka Chinese is mouth watering! Each dish made us feel droll. The smokey flavors of fried rice and noodles was very much appealing. Ambience was good, but the problem of mosquitoes is a little acute though delicious foods over - scored it! We noticed a good food serving and welcoming behaviour in Hakka Dhaka, but a bit more personal hygienic attitude was expected from the waiters. Overall, it's a geeat restaurant for foodies, a must visit place!",5,,454,Positive

"No complain about food. Though the food was more on spicy side but taste was good. But you guys need serious improvement in your service and in your offerings. You don't follow what you preach! We were 11 people went to have lunch and picked your 299 set menu offer (circulated in your FB page). You had different options in the set like rice/noodles, beef/chicken etc. but the first thing you said everybody has to choose one item! why?? if so then why did you keep the options?? And later you denied 10% discount on women's day celebration which is clearly mentioned in your page. Very disappointing! These days people do talk/share. So you should be very cautious about it. Nobody will visit twice if you do not take care of your customers.",3,,743,Positive

"I have been a regular at Hakka Dhaka ever since the very start of their venture with their small restaurant at Banani. Ever since the very beginning they realized the fact that they might be the ""under-dog"" of the industry which motivated them to provide the most superior value possible which kept me coming back time and again, but this favorite restaurant of mine disappointed me quite a bit the past couple of my visits. I believe that in order to maximize the value provided... to the customers, a good service is as crucial as good food. Even though their food remains to be fantastic, it's their service that continues to frustrate me. It really pains me to say this as one of the owners is a good acquaintance of mine but even though the management is absolutely top notch, their service providers (a.k.a. Waiters) has some of the most unsophisticated and un-professional attitude and this just keeps getting worse. It is not always possible for the management to engage the customers directly, hence it is these waiters who end up being the face of the restaurant and it is not a pretty face. Please do not take it as a sign of aggression but rather a constructive criticism from a fan of the place. I am posting this here instead of a third party forum (such as foodbank) in the hope that the management takes notice of this issue. Apologies for the rant. Regards, Faiz.",3,,1380,Positive

Had dinner at Hakka Dhaka last night and simply loved it! The owner himself came over at the table to explain the menu & to suggest what we should order! Now that you don't see everyday!

Amazing food!!!!Simply loveeee Hakka Dhaka!!,5,,44,Positive
"Chinese as it should be! The exterior of the shop reminded me of Chinatown in Leicester sq. and the food had the authenticity that most shops fail to deliver. The wings, crispy beef and prawns in particular, insanely good. And to go with it the pricing is reasonable. If the owners manage to keep the quality consistent and continue to give personal attention to customers, then Hakka Dhaka is definitely going places.",5,,418,Positive
Loved the food and the place!!!,5,,31,Positive
"Great food, cozy setup, good pricing & location. First time to get a reservation confirmed over facebook message. Awaiting full launch and new menu for soups etc. They're a hit even with soft launch and two set menu! Had Platter A with parents, wife & kids, gotta visit again for Platter B.

Food was good . Bt if your upper floor is pre booked then say it to your customers before they sit there .

You shouldâ€™ve say that earlier.Hopefully next time we wonâ€™t have to face that situation â˜ºï¸,3,,300,Positive
"The Sirloin Steak Bento was good. It has few other items like chicken wings, Prawn spring Roll, Fried Prawn. Taste of steak was just OK, nothing to say ""wow"". Mashed potato was too soft. However it is a good deal to share between Two. Their potato wedges is very good.",4,,268,Positive

Joey and Levi are the best! My favorite place in savannah! Always quick and wonderful service! Great drinks!,5,,108,Positive
"I went there yesterday with my friends. We ordered Chicken steak with fried rice and beef steak also. It was awesome in one words. I think, i ate one of the best steak in dhaka City. They served nicely and did not take long time to serve. But negative thing is that they have no sufficient soft drinks so that it was very tough to choice one for drinking. Anyway though food was little bit costly but taste was good so that anybody should consider that cost!!",5,,459,Positive

Food was good!But I was a bit too spicy.,5,,40,Positive
"For me,this is the best place for CHICKEN STEAK ï¿½ even the environment without any AC & entire decoration is nicely settled... each & every item in a platter just worthy ï¿½ but little bit disappoint that they don't serve any regular soft drink also their mentioned drinks are too expensive & don't have much varieties as well.. better to concentrate on it as well ï¿½",4,,370,Positive
Amazing food and brilliant ambiance. The chicken steak is top notch. Mashed potato can be a little more creamy. Other than that it's amazing,5,,140,Positive
Visited there more than 5 times because I am a big fan of their chicken steak platter & lemon chicken but last week I found there food wasn't that good as before which is disappointing.should upgrade their service as well.,3,,222,Positive

I ordered chicken steak and pineapple juice.both food was good and tasty..,5,,74,Positive
"I found it to be consistent. Went there on 25/2/17. It was probably my 3rd or 4th visit and the food quality remained good like before. Their chicken steak is something I crave for every single day. I tried their platter 'Epic Romance' and the chicken steak and the jumbo prawns were definitely highlight of the dish. The wedges were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and the cheesy rice complimented the dish pretty well. I would also suggest their beef bento and their lemon chicken meal. Those are really good too.",5,,525,Positive
Very good food and also good service.....ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,5,,50,Positive

Good taste... Good Presentation... The mouthwatering flavour of the steak,5,,73,Positive
They didn't take Amex card. Got really embarrassing after we were done eating and I didn't have cash to pay the bill. I had to call a friend and ask him to send money via Bkash and wait for 30 minutes for the transfer to happen. They didn't even have bank transfer facility to make things easy. Very bad experience on that end. Food was good though.,3,,349,Positive
"Love the place, the aesthetics, the food, and the service. In any aspect, one critical factor is style and originality; Treehouse has an abundance of it Ideal if you want to take someone out for a great meal and a meaningful conversation; the place itself is a great conversation starter Not ideal at all of you wanna skip class and go there for some ""hanky-panky"". You better stick to Argeela for it Be ready to spend about 1k-2k per person",5,,441,Positive
"Environment was good but I didn't like the chicken steak at all (especially the rice ï¿½ï¿½) but the beef bento platter was really a great combination,must try...",4,,162,Positive
"I and my wife went to Tree House yesterday. We ordered the bento box of beef steak. The taste of all the elements of bento box was very good. It was definitely pricey compare to the quantity which wasn't even enough for 2 persons. We had one watermelon drink and our bill came down to around Tk.1620.00. After paying that bill, we couldn't fully satisfy our hunger. The service and presentation were okay.",3,,405,Positive

Definitely a bit pricey but the food was worth it. Liked the ambience of the 2nd floor but not the 1st. 1st floor seemed to be very stuffy even on a rainy day. Maybe another AC could fix that? Ordered a beef bento as well as a chicken steak. Loved every bit of the food other than the veggies (this might be a personal preference). Had a great time. Thank you! ^_^,5,,364,Positive
"I went with a huge of hope. Lemon Chicken was just off bone drumstick of chicken, but not juice or burnt. Its a mild taste. I order chicken steak too, chicken with breast skin wasn't cooked perfectly. but potato wedges, salad was too good. Drinks price is HIGH",3,,260,Positive
"After a long time, wish to visit a restaurant again. Tree House: I was feeling disappointed when I was entering in the place. The place is really very small but food and ambience was good.

You people made our day. Thank you for all your supports. Wonderful decoration and super tasty food and peaceful place. Just totally loved it. Spend one of the best days of my life till now.,5,,190,Positive
"I had visited this place before, and the first time was satisfactory and for the price, they have a standard and likable menu. But as I'm writing this now there's a notable callousness from their part which can be something anyone is likely to face trouble with. I have had dinner with my family yesterday and took three of their current iftar platters alongside one sea food platter from their usual menu. The food was nothing special but it didn't lack taste either. The icecrea...m that was with the iftar platter was melted though. However, the issue that occured is when we were provided with the bill, the sea food platter stated 1597tk (vat excl.) This was startling for us as in all their menues it had 597tk written on it. When heading out we pointed it out and they merely apologised. My concern is that it is a restaurant's responsibility to correctly and accurately list down information of every item. The customers decide on a menu weighting down on both the price and food combined, an error such as this does not only put the customers at inconvenience but is mainly very misleading.",3,,1099,Positive
"Just had iftar and alhamdulillah, foods are delicious. I really like the service, despite getting into the last moment of azan, our sit was still reserved :)",4,,157,Positive

"A splendid place to hang out with the dearest ones. Food is delicious, and I personally recommend everyone to try the Buffalo Wings, those are too tasty. Service was good, and it's really nice that they only serve food and beverage of their own, they even don't sell coke or any other beverages. Instead, you can go for their organic juices, which I liked a lot. Finally, this place is worth of giving a try.",4,,408,Positive

"In a city of bricks and concretes, yesterday I chose to be at a place like ""Triangle cafe"" for Iftar. The place is situated just beside 3/a Dhanmondi lake, if you're a nature lover like me then its the perfect place for enjoying the soothing weather and gentle breeze of this monsoon. Triangle had two platers, one with a rice bowl and the other offering chowmein. Being a chowmein lover I ordered plater 2 and I have to agree the food was great in quality and sufficient in quantity for one. The BBQ chicken is a must try and also the kebab roll was juicy and spicy. The chowmein tasted perfectly seasoned. Both the platers are priced 450/- BDT all inclusive. I will recommend everyone who is looking for an escape out of this city sensationalism, Triangle is your place to feel the nature and enjoy a quality time with mouthwatering food.",5,,840,Positive

"We had total 10 burgers with the BUY ONE GET ONE FREE offer and all of them were so good.

"Itâ€™s burger greatness in the most primitive way, large enough to satisfy any hungry burger boy or girl, impossibly juicy and flavorful as can be. The cheese, Vermont Cheddar, adds the flavor it needs to, but could be more melted, although thatâ€™s a recurring problem with most burgers and the cheese that sits atop them in this city. The fries are delicious as well, golden, crispy and beautifully salty, what more do you want?",5,,430,Positive
"The Burger patty is really good. Their french fries, the drinks and even pizzas those i had hands on are a taste for the mouth. Well-mannered waiters are there to serve and assist if anything arises to occasion. And If you are wondering about Halal which you should especially in a place like ours, they have these issues covered.Overall, it's a Good Pass from me.",5,,364,Positive

Just asked for a thin and VoilÃ  it'll appear in front of you in a moment. But still the behavior of their cashier should be more realistic, more human like. And also they need to put chairs and tables at a distance. It's like a fish market along with putting some kind of door or barrier for separating the Kids zone. The sound was harrowing.

"I'm staying in Lalbag from last 2year. In the begging it was ok. But now need to tolerate. The people who born in Lalbag around 80s, they are friendly but the new comer and the people who is leaving since 10 or 15year, they don't count old ages or new ages. They always having some attitude, which is disgusting. Sewerage and the roads are damage may be from last 6-7 year but who care. Old-young all they don't care about future, they live for today. That's why I saw many people who had some properties, now they are living in rent. Sorry if I hart anybody but this is my experience in Lalbag.",4,,595,Positive

"Went there last Friday with my friend, got surprised a bit seeing such a small place. Upon arrival they waiter attended us with details of their menu as they prepare steaks in two types of Texas style with some deviations. We selected a Sirloin and Tomahawk, which were 300g and 500g. The truth is we were a bit skeptic about the weight they were mentioning but to our surprise they showed us the raw steaks that they were about to prepare for us. This was a nice touch. Liked the... way they ask customers approval for the cuts before preparing it as they were doing it for all the guests in other tables too. After waiting for around 30 mins, the steaks arrived. We ordered medium done and medium rare the steaks were exactly like we ordered. The medium rare Tomahawk tasted even better than my medium done Sirloin. Both the steaks had sof juicy center with flavorful seared crusts. Loved every bite of the tender steak till the end. The portion is quite hefty along with the sides of mashed potato and sautee vegetables. The sauces were nice compliment to the steak, would recommend their roast bacon glace for sure. This will be my steak place from now on for as long as they serve steaks like that.",5,,1203,Positive

"First glimpse will depict a small cozy diner bustling with energy as I have been there at dinner time. Fortunately we got our seats as we reserved earlier that day through phone. Ordered a Ribeye and Sirloin which were 300g each as per menu and done in true Texas style, which I was a bit skeptic at first. Then to my surprise they bought the raw cut in front of us and asked if we liked the cut and marbling. This is something we never experience in any steakhouse before, no one... asks about marbling of the meat in any steakhouse so far I have visited in Bangladesh. I started loving the place form that moment as the Ribeye had very good marbling in it. Just after that they served us complementary corn soups which were good gesture from their behalf and it was good too. Had to wait nearly 25 mins before we got the food and my friend asked the waiter why it takes this long to serve, then we came to know about the smoking process. They actually smoke each and every steak with imported woodchips and when we asked if they could show us the woodchips they certainly did, mixture of dry Apple & Hickory woodchips! Finally the steaks arrived and wow, perfectly seared medium rare steaks with juicy slight red center and dark crust outside. The first bite actually depicted all about that smoking stuff and for real it felt like I having a real steak, which I have seen for so long in TLC and other TV shows. The perfect thickness, sides of mashed potato and amazing sauces, though I did not like to use sauce in steaks as they are supposed to be juicy for medium rare done and in this case it was. Their service was good too as the waiters were polite and knowledgeable. This is my new favorite place for steaks and would highly recommend if anyone is looking for thick cut juicy steaks in Dhaka.",5,,1802,Positive

The sauses enhanced the flavor of the steak.

"Woodhouse Grill never disappoints me! Visited them quite a few times already and loved their service every time! If you are visiting them for the first time, rather then going for any other combo I'd recommend to go for their classic steaks like T-bone, Tomahawk, Sirloin or Rib eye. I've tried all of them in a medium well done preparation and they taste great! Looking forward to visiting them again. Good luck Woodhouse Grill! ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘",,TRUE,437,Positive

Their environment is very nice & clean and excellent service staffs although space is low comparing to other restaurants. Price is a little bit expensive but I found it worthy when I tasted the steak...its size, tenderness erc. Overall its a good restaurant to visit.",5,,457,Positive

"Me and my friend absolutely loved their food! This is gonna be our next favourite place! ï¿½ I loved their service, behavior, place and all ..Keep it up ï¿½",5,,156,Positive
A great collection of prime cuts. The sides were not all that good. I'll recommend the mushroom and grilled vegetables as sides. But hey need some serious work on doneness. We ordered two medium rare rib eyes. Although the cuts were nice and thick one was way too rare the other way too well done. The searing was good. The drinks were chilled. Appetizers were great. Will come again.,4,,384,Positive
"As a beef lover, I loved the steak and the steak loved me back",5,,62,Positive

The food was good. Only one problem is that the place is too small. When there is a little bit more customers.. they became nervous... and made a little bit of mess while serving. The steak was good... I enjoyed the food,4,,220,Positive
Loved their steak! It was fresh and nicely cooked. Very well behaved and nice. Will recommend it to others. Keep up the good work!,5,,130,Positive
I visited the place with several colleagues yesterday for lunch. I had a mushroom stake. The stake was cooked to perfection. I really liked the food. Would love to go there again. One small thing is when the generator is on it makes noise which is a bit too much. They should find a way to minimize the sound inside the restaurant.,4,,331,Positive
"Excellent Food, Good service! Hope it stays always like this! :)",5,,64,Positive
"Taste I would give 7/10, Comparing the price the vegetables are less in amount. Accommodation is not up to standard to the Food Menu status and price. Washroom facility not OK. For Family and Ladies its a Hastel to use washroom out side of main place.",3,,251,Positive
Had one of the best Steaks in town!! Tried the T-Bone and the Rib Eye and both were top notch. The ambience was soothing and the service was brilliant by the staffs to go with it. Would suggest it to any steak lover. Will definitely drop by again to try their other steaks.,5,,273,Positive

Good foods ... I love this place and I'll come again this place with my family,5,,78,Positive
"It's 4.5/5 actually. I want to say ""I loved it"" but minute details are holding me back. ""I really liked it!"" aptly describes it. Flavorful, tender, almost perfectly cooked ribeye and sirloin (5/5 for those) but t-bone was on the dry side. All sauces were on point though. (I'd recommend the hollaindase, pepper and bacon glaze hands down.) This place is a refreshing and much needed whiff of fresh air in the Dhaka steak situation. Definitely worth a try. I'm definitely going back (for the sirloin ï¿½) Also, 5/5 for hospitality. ï¿½",4,,534,Positive

"Went to Woodhouse Grill today. Already I had an Experience about the Steak in Bangladesh. So as usual with timid heart and boosted morale entered to the venue. Little small but neat and clean.....the employees are very cordial...soft spoken and well trained. They I have seen describing the customers in detail about the type of cut, dish and side dishes. I have met the owner little latter. He was also very cordial and helpful. To taste for the 1st time....I asked for a Pepper ...Steak and level of cooking I asked is Medium well done. I received the food and cut the piece of meat....the knife was smooth and I put the first piece in my mouth.....mmmmm....delicious.....but the cooking was Well Done. The owner observed my food and he was not satisfied with the cooking level, he returned my steak back and served another steak cooked in perfection as Medium Well Done. The incident depict how sincere and customer oriented they are. I am fully satisfied and wish to go frequently there. If the remain committed regarding their standard and customer satisfaction no doubt they will rise above the horizon....Viva Woodhouse Grill. I definitely recommend to taste the steak in Woodhouse Grill.",5,,1195,Positive

We took chicken cashew nut salad as well as Thai fried rice, which were good, as well as their buffalo wings. But the beef sizzling that we ordered was pretty much burnt as the bottom part of the dish was clearly overcooked, unlike the almost undercooked top half. Nonetheless, they have good menu and a clean environment. Hope they improve more.",3,,454,Positive

Thanks to #foodbuzz for making a special day â€˜Super Specialâ€™! Today I want to express my gratitude to foodbuzz who unconditionally helped me create a special memory! I wanted to give a surprise to my special one on our Aniversiry.The initial plan was to gather at foobuzz with all our friends and spend a nice time together. But I wasnâ€™t sure if the people from there would cooperate without any booking or any charge. So I called at the number from their Facebook page and I was surprised instead at the enthusiasm and willingness they showed.There isnâ€™t much I can do to repay them but I at least wanted to thank them here and inform people about their hospitality,5,,674,Positive
Tried the Larb Gai salad. Happy me :) Awesome place for partying.,5,,65,Positive
"Place : #foodbuzz ok so before I start rating their food and service and what not let me start off by saying what they did right that other restaurants usually don't. 1st - The food actually looks as they were advertised. 2nd - They actually served the food hot, yes you heard it right ""HOT"" this is where a lot of restaurant fails. They served all the food at the right time and in right order. ok now let's move on to what you guys really care about. Items -9/10 :kabsha, chusanut salad. Taste -9/10: I don't believe in perfection but this came pretty close, I would still rate it 9 but I gave 10 for a reason and I'll explain that in a bit. So anyway the chusanut salad really hot when it was served and it was tasty as well. Every item on that platter was upto the mark. Sorry I don't know the name of all the items otherwise I would've explained each item by their taste. Quantity: [10/10]: I don't know how much you can eat but I can eat a lot and I can tell you it's more than enough for 4 person.",5,,1004,Positive

Their lemon loaf is fantastic. But the salad is a deep disappointment. One teaspoon of dressing doesn't make the hearty portion any better. Also the flavours of chicken is very blunt.

Pretty good effort. They have been able to keep quality for a long time - always a major plus for Dhaka foods. Good value for money. Keeps your tummy full. Could improve with more and better options. Maybe with time. Their wraps are the Bangla version of Subway. Healthy and tasty.,4,,281,Positive

Love the place. I'm a regular customer here and I always bring my friends here to try their Gulab Jamun Cheesecake. They also make great wraps and you get to choose what ingredients go into it.

The food is amazing but yesterday was the 4th time they either didn't have a wrap and can only give salad bowls or didn't have one of the two beef or chicken. Since the menu is really limited you guys should atleast try have a better stock so you can serve whatever is on the menu for that day instead of telling the customers they can only have salad bowls or only the beef with limited salad.,3,,394,Positive

"""Its okay"" perfectly sums up the experience... Not to expensive, neither it's cheap, it's just okay...

Another less star as service is very slow and the place is cramped... Tea was good... Taste of wrap was okay...",3,,392,Positive

"Environment is good, food is also tasty but you need to give more attention on your service quality, waiters are not available when we need, even they have no combination in giving service, 3-4 waiters are giving service in one table other peopleâ€™s are waiting, so you need to much improve in management, Otherwise it was pretty good ï¿½ï¿½",4,,342,Positive
"Had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant on my short, but memorable trip to Dhaka almost two summers ago. The environment is clean and neat unlike the dark, dimly lit restaurants found lurking all over Dhaka city. The food and service were absolutely divine. Coming to Dhaka I realized nothing is truly authentic, you are expected to run into the fusions here. This restaurant takes the hat in asian fusion food. The exotic looking menu and the fresh quality food here was something remembered from my South Asia tour. Congratulations to the restaurant on holding their standard high over the course of the years. Locals say it's been around for more than 20 years and it shows in their service! I look forward to coming back and try those crabs again!",5,,756,Positive

"Makes me nostalgic every time I visit this place. Have dined here since I was 4/5 years old I guess. Food is epic. Not to mention the service. Will definitely be one of my favorite places of all time.

Wish you guys all the best (y)",4,,399,Positive

"Some of your foods are very good and some of your foods should be improved. The mushroom, bean and sausage in your breakfast should be improved in taste.

It is ok but still i think its not value for money. A bit over priced. On top of dat they sum up all the food cost including beverages and then add VAT on it. But i guess u can not charge 15% VAT on beverages. Well i m not 100% sure though.,3,,240,Positive

I went there yesterday. It was a busy time. I ordered Steam rice with Steam chicken for me and Grilled chicken for my friend. Unfortunately both chicken were cold but part of the grilled chicken was very cold. I ordered Latte and at last but to be honest it was cold as well. the Waiters need to be little bit more trained as I was looking for them at least 7-10 mins to clean my table and also they should have some knowledge about the food. Overall I can not give more than 3 star this time. Hope next time I will have a more good experience. Thanks,3,,551,Positive

Having the real taste of Gloria jeans one need to have a good idea of their food menu.. and need to be very sure about what his/her mouth wants... coffees are really good here and one can try the burgers and sandwiches here as well... especial mention should be their lil chocolate brownies and Trimishu cake... the ambiance is really good... it seems to me the complete coffee cafe in BD... which can match up with the taste of a loving couple's chilling to a corporate business deal over a cup of coffee.,4,,506,Positive

One of the best place to dine... Kebabs are fantastic... very good Hamus... beautiful decorations... set menus are reasonable... must try...,5,,140,Positive
nice place and food was to good,,TRUE,31,Positive
"The first glance of the place with its magnificent Lebanese inspired decorations immediately gave out an impression of the middle east. Simple yet subtle. The moment I took a bite of the kabab, I felt like I was back in the Arabian peninsula. The soft arabian music and the lightings and ofcourse the humble waiters dressed in the finest attires helped to complement the feel I suppose. They really did deliver the so called Arab ""ZAYKA"". If nothing else the chefs of this place are some of the finest artists in the world. A 5 star rating would not suffice to describe the experience. I offer them my compliments and look forward to their future endeavours.",5,,658,Positive
I just love this place . nd the food was too good.,,TRUE,50,Positive
First of all the decoration of the place is too beautiful. It increases with the Lebanese songs. The food we ordered was happy hour set menu which was so delicious specially the chicken mushroom curry and rice. Quantity was also good for single person. The sauce needs to be better as it was slight spicy. Chicken was average. The behaviour of the staffs was not good that I experienced. I found them kinda rude. When we were selecting the food from the menu they immigrated showed us another menu and said may be we could not afford that. That was so insulting though we all stayed there to taste the food. Overall the experience was good except the behaviour of the staffs.,4,,675,Positive
"Definitely authentic Arabian foods, loved the ambience. Anyone who loves Arabian must try out this place",,TRUE,104,Positive
Finally I loved your Iftar platter. The place is welcoming with quality service. Keep it up! :),5,,95,Positive
the food was worth every single penny.behaviour was commendable as well.overall a good place to go with family & friends.,,TRUE,121,Positive
"I'm not sure why but word around town is that this place sucks. It definitely doesn't. The kebab items, especially the shish tawuq was quite good. Condiments were nice. The only thing I'd complain about is price - it's quite expensive. A two person sharing kebab platter with drinks will easily cost you 2000 bdt or a little less than USD 30.",4,,342,Positive

"There was no reason to go here, specifically, as my friend and I were both on a tight schedule. He had come on a return visit to his homeland from America, and wanted to meet up, after 12 years (for him) and 20 years for me.. also looking for a place near his old house where he grew up. It was just beyond! Meeting a friend after 20 years can be a very, very surreal experience, and I am quite glad that Al-Amar helped to enclose those memories.",5,,446,Positive

"I did not find the food comparable to authentic Arabic food - the Khabsah for one , was the worst. The others were better , and OK. Did not taste like real KSA food or Arabic food , to be honest . They did serve a garlic sauce, which appeared to have been made by someone who never tasted real garlic sauce from the mid- east. The owners need to visit the mid- east before they can successfully add that Arabic touch to their food.",3,,431,Positive
I enjoyed the food. And their service also. I would recommend this resturent.,4,,77,Positive
Last year when I visited Al Amar I was really happy with their service and authentic Lebanese taste. I actually found the Arabic taste same as abroad.

Really recommended and I will inspire everyone to visit Al Amar at least once and try their Mix Grill / Hummus and Lemon with mint(Drinks),5,,434,Positive

"Yaa habibi!! The hummus is divine, the tahine thick and rich, and the dÃ©cor and music all transport you to a magical Mediterranean realm. Al-Amar features a wide variety of Lebanese as well as Oriental dishes. True that the price is somewhat above the average range for restaurants in the area, but it's still within reasonable limits given the quality and portions of the food served, and the warm service received. The drinks are interestingly refreshing. We opted for the hummus and kafta antabli (lamb skewers), the ice honey tea and mint lemonade. Not disappointed at all. Very pleasant atmosphere too.",5,,608,Positive

"We placed an order over the phone for takeaway and were told that food would be ready in approximately 35 mins. I went after 45 mins to pick up the food and it still wasn't ready. I had to wait another 10 mins for them to prepare the parcel. Other than this setback, let's get into the food review: 1) Lamb Kabseh, priced at 645++. The meat & rice were cooked well and the portions were sufficient for 2 (provided you take some appetizers). However, I did not really like the over...whelming tomato taste. I prefer a drier kabseh with bigger portions of meat and garlic sauce but that's just my opinion. I'd rate this 2.5/5. Since it's quite pricey, I don't really recommend this. 2) Hommos, priced at 325++. Although this may sound too expensive for just mashed chickpeas with a bit of oil and mild seasoning, trust me it's worth it. Portions are more than enough to share for 2 (you can even take this for 3). Also, you can get extra bread for 20 taka each if you do run out of bread. I'd rate this 4/5. Highly recommended. 3) Lahem Bi Ajin, priced at 300++. These are mini beef keema pizzas which taste fantastic!!! Initially I was expecting a gravy dish because the description says 'marinated minced beef cooked with spices & tomatoes the traditional way' and was kinda bummed out when I saw mini pizzas but once I took a bite, I was blown away. They also give you a slice of yellow lemon (proper imported yellow lemon, and not the crap we get here which are being passed off as lemons) which adds so much to the flavor of the dish. 5/5, I'd have this everytime I go there. And since you get 8 slices, it's superb value for money for 2 people. My total bill was 1537 BDT (including 6% service charge and 15% VAT). I am quite confused as to why I had to pay service charge for a takeaway order, they definitely should remove that. Otherwise, it's not too heavy on the pocket for something different (provided you don't take the kabseh).",4,,1940,Positive

"Had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant on my short, but memorable trip to Dhaka almost two summers ago. The environment is clean and neat unlike the dark, dimly lit restaurants found lurking all over Dhaka city. The food and service were absolutely divine. Coming to Dhaka I realized nothing is truly authentic, you are expected to run into the fusions here. This restaurant takes the hat in asian fusion food. The exotic looking menu and the fresh quality food here was something remembered from my South Asia tour. Congratulations to the restaurant on holding their standard high over the course of the years. Locals say it's been around for more than 20 years and it shows in their service! I look forward to coming back and try those crabs again!",5,,756,Positive

One of our favorite places to have Sehri with friends and family . Love their simplicity yet the deliciousness with the dishes . The Naan Thali is amazing .

I strongly recommend others to take their loved ones to Tarka where you get value for your money and food is extremely tasty .,5,,394,Positive

"Its not rocket science as to figure out why i go back to Tarka again & again and during Ramzan, I thought of giving a break but alas! Just had the Jilapi or Jalebi as they spell like this for some weird unknown reason & hands down this is the best in town. Any other argument regarding this is invalid. Period! Also tried their Ramzan Special 'Nan Thali' & its amazing value for money. The taste is as usual superbly trustworthy like their other foods. I actually have to order an extra butter Nan to finish off the nan-thali coz the amount is so much. highly recommend this place during the Ramzan & other times.",5,,613,Positive

"There was a time not long ago when the choice for good authentic Indian restaurant in Dhaka was limited to Sajna and Khazana only, and then came Tarka with their mind blowing ""never tasted"" authentic Indian menu in a casual yet classy ambiance. So far I have tried all of their lunch thalis (except Veggie and Rice, as I am not much into those), and from their regular menu mutton hyderbadi biriyani, chicken lagawab makhani, beef boti, chickten tikka, khusnama kabab, daal butter... fry, matar paneer, mughal chicken, kashmiri/butter/garlic nan and I can't rank anyone better than the other as for their quality is 5 star. As for the drinks my favorite is Jeera Pani. It's also good to see that their service level has drastically improved since their inception and now I don't mind paying the 7% service charge. Also a nice addition was their Iftar menu during Ramadan and particularly the 'haleem' which I fell in love after first sip. I have intentionally held off my review until now as I wanted to test them over time for their consistency which they have proved so far. Keep up the great taste & service and wish you all the best in the business.",5,,1153,Positive

Seriously didnt like this attitude. Please don't do this again. Now comes the food rating - Food- 10/10 (best Indian food in town). Specially the Lassi.

"Well as i was born and bought up in this area I had basically tried all kinds of food around this place...so not gonna lie.... Now about pizza....i basically like it cause the crust the flavor all of it is good like if u expect to have a real pizza there are other places for that this pizza is for people who eats outside regularly and want some good food in a cheap rate.This is why i said good instead of 'soo good' Told ya not gonna lie About the place and environment - it's ...a street food court so it's under the open sky.You can bring hr friends and family and have a good time.And as usual there are some overly attached couples who comes here & makes us uncomfortable, i guess if u are not a hypocrite u wouldn't put the blame on this place. In the end all i have to say about this place is ""places with good food and environment is not that available .But this place is all of it "" ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½",5,,903,Positive
"Well the crust was really thin, almost felt Like a Nun Ruti. Amount of cheese was okay. Among the toppings, tomatoes and onions were abundant in the beef pizza. Portion of beef is again okay though there was hardly any chicken in the chicken pizza. You can also count the olives. The overall taste was good for 200tk. But considering the toppings, 200 tk is not cheap rather an okay price tag. They only have 8 inch pizzas. For a guy like me, I could easily eat Two and go for ...a kacchi afterwards. (Not Kidding). You can give it a try but not really a place to go back just to have the pizza. Great try though. Cheers.",3,,621,Positive

Just love their food. Environment is peaceful.,,TRUE,46,Positive
"Love this place! They are a fine dining establishment, with really great food, great service and, as expected, a hefty price tag against every item available. Despite of the feeling of despair I get whilst paying the bill, I still managed to go there a number of times, and haven't been disappointed once However, my latest visit was yesterday, and this time around, I faced a serious problem which prompted me to write this review. We ordered ""Beef Udon Noodles"" which is a fav...orite of my wife, and at the very end of the dish, we found some coiled strings. These things definitely came from the wired sponges that are used for scrubbing the plates when a dish washer is not available. So the person who cleaned the plates wasn't competent, and the chef was not vigilant enough to check this before serving the dish. It wasn't a big deal, but we had a bad feeling. We kind of lost our appetite, and called in the waiter to tell this to his manager. Knowing Bangladeshi restaurants, we weren't hoping for much. However, the manager came in almost running, and profusely apologized. He wanted to replace the dish. But by then, we were full and didn't have the appetite to eat more. So I refused. Then the manager told us that he will remove the bill for the noodles, and we can have any main dish from the menu for free. When I said we are no longer hungry, he said we can also have it made for ""take away"". By then, I was quite surprised. I haven't really seen such behavior from any other restaurant in Dhaka. But then again, I also did not find strings in the food in any other restaurant. But that is not really the point, the point is the nice gesture shown by Umai. After declining this generous offer, the manager seemed sad and apologized again and left. After 4-5 minutes, I asked for the bill, and the waiter informed that we will be served complimentary desserts and then the bill will be given. This was something I could not refuse. So me, my wife and child totally enjoyed the free Banana Katsu dessert (which was the most expensive dessert in the menu) and came out with a satisfied mind. I hope they continue this kind of customer service and improve the kitchen vigilance. I wish them all the best as I want them to stick around and keep on serving us high quality Japanese food.",5,,2298,Positive

"The salmon belly was absolutely mouthwatering, authentic japanese taste..so was the fresh salmon salad, the dish lives up to its name..the devils breath maki rolls were really good too! All in all, most of the food items are amazing and the overall food experience very good!",5,,275,Positive
"Food is awesome, and has some thing special which will drive you here again and again. Visited with my family and had chicken teriyaki, deep fried Seafood, fried prawn, Umai special soup with strip of loin beef and for desert banana kastu. All were very good and unique in taste. Must complement their Japanese Chef and the Umai management. All foods are imported and service is excellent as well.",5,,397,Positive
"Frankly the best sushi I had in a while. From the food to the ambiance to the staff, everything SCREAMS five star. If you're ready to drop some serious cash and a taste for the high end, you'll love this place!",4,,210,Positive
I was first time goer to Umai last evening. It was a great evening with my cousin-sister & sister like friend. My sister (cousin) recommended salmon teriyaki as I was looking for something on Salmon for long.. It was pretty good but I think they put less salt on it. Ambiance is perfect for any chaos/noise free dining with loved ones.,3,,335,Positive
"Such a overpriced menu! Prices are more than even Sydney :O There are lots of sushi/Bento shops around Sydney City, provides more quantities/varieties in Bento with even lesser price (around $6-$10 = BDT 350-550) Sushi long each $3-$4 (150-240 BDT) Considering cost in Sydney (place and stuff cost in Sydney at least 10 times than BD..) what would be the reason of such high price??",3,,382,Positive
"Far from a conventional Japanese diner, UMAI is haute to the hilt. Purely the name suggests, the menu offers widest gamut of mouth-watering delicacies, including scrumptious sea foods, zesty meats, splendiferous staples, as well as tantalizing desserts. This chiefly Japanese restaurant is one culinary casting that satiate an appetite, and worthy of repeated encores...",5,,370,Positive
"Very good preparation - really tasty. Will be coming again as soon as possible. As usual though, food price in Bangladesh is fashionably exorbitant. Umai needs to look into the portion of each serving/ dish.",5,,207,Positive

The food quality was good but serving size could be increased considering that the price is quite high compared to other high end restaurants in Gulshan. Suggest to sign up with Amex and Visa for promotions which other restaurants are doing especially upscale restaurants which offer up to 20% discount. Could offer live cooking stations like at Wasabi. The seating areas are quite congested with limited seating space.,4,,419,Positive

I have always been a great fan of Lucknow. I have always found it homely since inception of Horitoki (it's previous name). But I would like to point out that: Staff: some of them are great but sometimes some of their staff seem indifferent to needs & Food: Their mixed vegetables contain more carrot than other veggies. First I thought it could be a random issue but later I found it to be true. I understand cutting cost but not expected from a high end restaurant like Lucknow.,4,,479,Positive
Nice place with good food.,,TRUE,26,Positive
"I m absolutely loved the food, The only thing that Lucknow does better than thier food is their service. Tariq was a super helpful manager, who made sure we taken care of amidst the hustle and bustle during the rush hour for seheri. Its one of the very few restaurants in dhaka who truly cares about thier customer. Cheers!",5,,323,Positive
nice foods ðŸ‘Œ different taste in every dishes ðŸ‘Œ,,TRUE,52,Positive
Me and my husband went there yesterday with our two kids. We went for lunch and that time most of the tables were empty and we wanted to sit at a corner table but the waiter told if there'll be more people they won't be able to sit and showed us a table just with the entrance gate. It was almost the ending time of lunch hour so how can they expect more guests and how rude was their behavior I was wondering. Although we didn't take that sit and choose another one. But this shouldn't be the behavior with the guests. Anyways foods were good.. handi biriany was horrible.. price is too high.. too 1 hour to serve the dishes.. service is too bad.. I don't recommend this place to anyone. Worst service I've ever seen.,3,,718,Positive
undoubtedly best kabab in the town. every time I visited the restaurant they have made their standards better than before. Consistancy of their food taste and quality is equal yet.,5,,180,Positive
i really love their food but the service need to better a lil bit .. bcoz last night i went there waiter was a lil bit off like he was bother that we were asking qus or ordering food.. after we done eating when i was looking for the person to can give us the bill . i saw another person i was calling him but he looked at me straight and left didnt even bother to come to out table .. i really didnt like that attitude .. plz do talk to the waiters .. that how to do customer service.. i know not all the waiters r not same .. but few of them have a bad attitude problme.. thank you.. i hope u will find the solution for this,,TRUE,625,Positive

One of best Indian food you can find in Dhaka. Gravy is the most recommended.,5,,77,Positive
"Let's talk about the place first. Located at the edge of Sat Masjid Road near the Dhanmondi 27 turning, which provides to be central location for people coming in from Mohammadpur, Lalmatia or Dhanmondi. While they do not have a dedicated parking place they try to make up for it by having numerous guards. Interior is very nice. Well decorated, modern and unlike some very dimly lit restaurants opening up nowadays, this proved to be a welcoming experience offering something qui...te on the contrary. The ambience is very inviting with music in the background and ample room between tables to not overhear the conversations from tables nearby. We were a family of four. After being handed the menu which had decent amount of items we ordered a standard Chinese dinner for my parents whilst me and my sister opted for something from the Indian cuisine. We had ordered more than our table of four could accumulate so were moved to a bigger table. Food was served within approximately 20 mins. The food was good, my parents seemed to enjoy the Chinese cuisine and from little of what I tasted i felt the quality was certainly there. My order of tandoori chicken was good but I felt the butter nan to be pretty dry. The owner as well as the manager came around to ask if the food was okay and I let them know of my dry experience of the nan and they immediately changed it. The second batch of nan was much better. Service proved to be admirable and quite helpful when needed. The staff behavior was excellent. All in all it was a great dining experience. A lot of the food we ordered were leftover so we packed it to take home. They gave us a promotional discount but the final bill without the discount seemed reasonable, we were actually expecting the bill to be more but pleasantly surprised. One of the managers actually walked us to our car while leaving. This feeling of exclusiveness felt great and really made you feel the restaurant is keen on delivering good food and service. Hope they are able to maintain this standard in the future. FINAL VERDICT: Location: 9/10 Interior: 10/10 Food: 10/10 Service: 10/10 Price: 9/10",5,,2130,Positive
"On of my favourite resturant, loved the food specially guwalati kabab and veg biryani.... Yummy",5,,95,Positive
Food was good. Service was great. Most delicious was grilled vetki and tandoori prawn. Kababs were average. Handi biriyani was ok. All other items were good enough. But the mutton nehari needs to improve. Also the shahi tukra was a bit weird. It tasted spicy and sweet both. But it should be sweet only. Kulfi was great. Price is too high. Thank you.,4,,350,Positive

"Having a restaurant like this just next to my house is a blessing. We people with friends used to just hang around here & there in searching a good food place with a great environment. Then this is. We have been there consecutively 2 days and tried pizza pasta and french fries. I must say pizza was just delicious. If you can just continue keeping this quality, you will be housefull shortly. Pasta was also good. Cheesy fries wasn't up to the mark I must say. This would be be...tter if you do it by baking in oven. and the flaw I must mention is your service. Waiters are not just accustomed to the typical restaurant service. Try experienced ones. This restaurant will be great place unless you people let the quality be beaten by popularity. :)",4,,749,Positive

Chui (à¦šà¦‡/à¦šà§à¦‡), the mighty spice that can make you drool anywhere at any moment ! The beef/mutton/chicken pieces where big enough to fill your tummy ! The pulse and the smashed potato are good too. You can choose your own damn meat and very own piece. The service persons are well behaved. Over all a damn cozy place to have lunch or dinner with your beloved ones. Loved it.",4,,507,Positive
"For me it was like tasting the flavour I always liked. It was not like what I used to have in Abbas Hotel or in Satkhira or in Khulna Zero Point but its one of the places where the traditional food of Khulna region can be found here in Dhaka. It made me feel nostalgic. So, I have no complain about the environment or service :)",5,,328,Positive
"The beef was too good today, chicken was good enough but the mutton was not so good....it was so-so. Choi Jhal you should add at least a decent dessert for the ending... The yogurt you served was the worst dish ever and for that the ends taste which left in the mouth was the worst. You should also do something about the mutton.",4,,329,Positive

"The size of the brownies is just too small. I'm paying 120 taka for a nutella topped cheesecake brownie but the size is simply disappointing. The taste is okay, it lacked depth and complexity. There was the bitterness of the chocolate which I liked. The brownie had a crunchy top and it was chewy overall, loved it. Overall it's okay. They are basically selling the same fudge brownie but with a different topping. My only problem is the size. It's not worth the money.",3,,469,Positive

The environment was excellent. The decoration is really beautiful. Loved the place. The behavior was good.

Being a coffee lover I needed a place where I can grab coffee everyday I tried Gloria jeans and many other but this place serves the satisfying cup of coffee, it is a must have. I also recommend trying the Thai soup and the basil leaf I suggest you ask to put chilies in the sauce, it's a to die for combination with the rice that is slightly sweet. If you're looking for a comfy friendly place to have dinner with it even coffee with friends or family I suggest you come here. Super impressed!!!",5,,595,Positive

But only thing so far i found totally absurd was the price of the local pepsi can which was 75tk 250ml which must not be more than 40tk highest, i myself buy ""imported"" pepsi or coke for 80tk, so for imported 330ml cans if you put the price over 100tk still i don't mind... but i am not bound to pay local 30-35tk cans for 75tk at least. It has nothing to do with service charge or any other expense, so no excuse please. One or two waiters need to know the basics before packing the left over foods as well.",4,,530,Positive

The PRICES seemed reasonable for 1:3 main dishes, 1:1 appetizers and deserts.",5,,503,Positive

"Today i had lunch there with some of my friends. The food tasted good as a whole, took Tom yum soup and mixed fried rich with morning glory, chicken hot besil leaf, fish garlic pepper. That was really very nice. Thai lemon mint & lemon grass was simply mouthwatering. Usually for us Bangladeshies, chinese and thai aren't really different. Because we take the cuisine and tailor it in our own way which doesn't leave much of aurhenticity or difference. And we prefer it rather than the original taste as it is spice laced enough to please our tastebud. But, this restaurant lives up to its name and surprisingly the authentic food tastes much much better than our BD style chinese/thai! Overall it was a good experience...",5,,722,Positive

Loved the place! One of the best thai food I had recently.. A must try!,4,,71,Positive
"The food tasted good as a whole, but I didn't like the mixed fried rice; to be very specific, it lacked seasoning, and had lumps of rice, which were not stir fried properly; the overdoneness came from the oozing mix of dark soya sauce. The Seafood Tom tum and chicken in coconut milk soups were tasty, but I've definitely tasted better flavoured ones in Dhaka. The prawn cakes tasted like store bought frozen ones, they were quite rubbery, the chicken satays tasted good. Chicken... with cashew nut, beef chilli and Fish with black pepper sauce were good, but nothing to be over-hyped about, as Dhaka has seen a vast number of restaurants serving Authentic Thai cuisine. The interior and service both were pleasant. I personally feel they still have space for improvement in their cooking techniques. Overall it was a good experience, my family was happy at the end of the day, and that's the most important thing.",3,,914,Positive

"The setting of the restaurant made up for the barely satisfactory food and mediocre service. The iced tea turned out to be the only passable item amongst what we ordered, the fried rice was poor, the green curry was thin and bland, the soup was cold, the beef was alright and the seafood was way below par. I would not recommend this place to a friend.",3,,352,Positive

"Just had an Absolute Feast with my family at Absolute Thai! Started off the evening with the Mixed Appetizers which was great while we waited (considering that it was a packed Friday night, it did take time, but also gave us the chance to chat). The food was brilliant, and 3 hours later, I am still full and can barely move. The Coconut soup with Seafood was my personal favourite! Supplemented by the Dim Sum, an item that appeared to be a Thai Fuchka and Thai Fishcakes dipped... in a Creamy Garlic Sauce, it was a great opener. We ordered loads of items but the Pad Thai, Red prawn and the Chicken with Green Curry particularly stood out. We ended the evening with the (sweet) Lemon Grass juice and the infamous Sticky Rice with Mango (which really lived upto its hype). The restaurant itself is cozy, comfortable, illimunaited and has a classy feel without trying hard. This place is a must for anyone looking for fine dining with quality Thai food.",5,,954,Positive
Not bad! It is fancy enough and I thought might be pretty expensive. But I would say quantity is good enough against price. Food is decent too. Liked what I ordered except Sticky Mango Rice. Kudos for the quantity they serve on dishes again!,4,,241,Positive

"Probably the best buffet restaurant for dinner in Dhanmondi in terms of food quality and variety, price and ambience with a few small shortcomings that you'd do well to be prepared for. The buffet begins at your table with ""starters"" i.e. the day's bbq served at your table - chicken, fish and mutton with naan, which is refilled as you finish the serving. Although the waiters claim that the starters are ""un-limited"", after you've asked for a refill twice, service slows down an...d the waiters begin to discourage you from asking for more refills by repeatedly telling you that the bbq is only a starter and that you can now try the main buffet. It might get annoying, but as I found out, it's not bad advice since the buffet is quite good. The main dishes aren't the same old buffet dinner fare you see over and over again, but different and tasty. Their chicken biryani, creamy chicken and lemon fish in particular were really good. The chicken soup and chicken basil leaf were a little too salty though. The others - onion prawn, shahi paneer, beef etc were good. Among their deserts, their shahi tukra and brownie were good while the others - bread pudding, firni, fruit etc were just plain. However, they also serve kulfi! It wasn't out of the world, but hey - it's kulfi! Overall, definitely a place I'd recommend for dinner. And if you take my advice - don't try to get all your money's worth from the bbq alone; save it for the buffet, it's worth it. P.S. the menu changes from day to day, and so might your experience there.",4,,1536,Positive

"This is my second visit to the restaurant. I went there for lunch. This time i found little poor service. The bbq they served on table was only limit to chicken, fish and pineapple. After the second serve of bbq the waiters were rushing us to start buffet. When we started buffet the waiters where rushing to cleanup and to serve desserts. This is very annoying. In main course they have very limited items including beef biryani. As i don't eat beef the option became more less for me. But overall still i am satisfied.",3,,520,Positive

The grill items were good . Specially their prawns. But they should improve the number in their buffet items. And they should improve their biryani ! A lil change will definitely improve their customers i believ!,3,,212,Positive

"Good variety of starters and main courses, but limited variety of desserts. Probably the best dining option in that area, which is quite important given the traffic in Dhaka. Only the buffet option is available, which is not convenient if you want to order something specific for a smaller amount, but overall the value for money is quite adequate. Drinks are not included in the buffet price.",4,,393,Positive
"Excellent food, beautiful interior, outstanding service.",5,,56,Positive
I loved their starter and desert!! ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ way too good.....!!!,5,,65,Positive
"It was nice, felt like an overseas buffet restaurant. The built-in BBQ grill table with unlimited kebabs is their main attraction. For starters, they served chicken boti, mutton shish, fish, Indian paneer & potato kebabs. I loved the chicken kebab most, it was well marinated with yogurt and spices. Other than that, they had chicken corn soup, papadums, chutneys & lots of salads. The main course had a rather small but good selection of dishes. The Hyderabadi biryani was nice b...ut the meat wasn't tender enough and it was made from ""mixed cuts"". I also liked the beef chili (bhuna), fish with lemon grass, prawn with tomato & basil and shahi paneer (similar to korma). There were only four dessert items with unlimited kulfi. The buffet price (Tk.1200) doesn't include VAT or any drinks. Overall, it would be better if they could include mutton boti kebab for starters and expand the menu for main course & dessert items.",4,,926,Positive
Billing sytem is bad..they take vat without vat registration number..food and environment is good..,3,,99,Positive
One of the best in town. Absolutely amazing. A must visit place.,5,,64,Positive

"From the outside it doesn't look much but its a different story once you step inside. Quite well decorated with comfortable sitting arrangements. Went there first time during for Iftar + dinner. The highlights of the menu were the whole lamb, whole fish, lasagna and teriyaki chicken. The lamb was well marinated and soft, while the fish was also equally marinated. The lasagna was exceptionally good specially for a buffet Iftar menu. One other thing which I liked was the live grilling station serving minute steaks, prawns and grilled mackerels. The staff were quite attentive, quickly clearing out our plates during the buffet and checked with us if food was ok or if we need anything else. Hope they can keep up the level of quality and service",5,,749,Positive

"Letâ€™s talk about service: in one word awesome, the quality of food was really good and mouthwatering. The environment was really nice. I liked the BBQ part itâ€™s really well cooked and juicy. Must visit this place for their quality food, hospitality and environment. Shaw's Steakhouse has already won acknowledgements and certifications for itâ€™s quality food, service & environment. Wish them all the very best in future.",5,,426,Positive
"First thing that i look when i reach an eatery is a parking spot, even though Shaw is located near a very busy exit but their outdoor personnel efficiently managed and secured me a good parking spot. The decor and the ambience is very luxurious but entering the place made me feel awkward as i found the restaurant staffs (waiters) themselves sitting at guest chairs and watching TV. They couches are very cozy to sit but i also think they congested the place with too much sittin...g arrangement. They should have left more free space for free movement even though they have such a big floor. Their food quality is excellent, the steaks were perfectly marinated and cooked to perfect flavors and temperature, the taste and the look shows that dishes are cooked delicately here. However the portion is the issue!! I think the servings are not adequate, even the pictures taken of the food on the plate looks poor. I think the main courses served should have the standard portion Quantity that any other fine dining offers. The Manager was a very nice gentlemen. And the waiter who served us was also very attentive and gentle. Also charging 15Tk only for the bottled water was cool !!",4,,1184,Positive

Amazing food and amazing service. Can't thank Nibedita Apu enough for suggesting this amazing place and making my evening so special.

"Service was OK. Didn't like the food though. The manager said it's on the French taste side but as we've never been to France nor could we validate that, neither could we enjoyed their sauces with sweet taste!!

"Well let's put it this way. This is definitely the best burger shop in khilgaon, but doesn't compare to take out or preetom. I go there almost every other day, and found the burgers to be inconsistent. Some days its really good and other days its meh. One full on negative point, SERVICE IS EXTREMELY SLOW. I dont mind if the place is small and if i have to wait to get a table, but damn it takes 45 mins to get 2 burgers out ? This happens every time. Not occasionally. Gotta fix that ASAP.",3,,491,Positive

Please try to serve all the food at a time. Otherwise, we customers get confused. ""Where is my French fry? Where is my coke?"" :p Anyway, best of luck guys. Will be there again.",4,,522,Positive

"My student was asking me for the past year to meet up with him near his old house. I just couldn't make any time, until today. :( :) I looked up the food places near Taj Mohol road, Dhaka on Google maps, and it was the same old same old, BFC/KFC/Pizza Hut BS. I didn't want to go to any of them. I wanted to try some place new. As I kept searching a little marker stood in one far north-west corner of the map. It read Bell Pattio. I called my student and we met up nearby, only t...o be greeted by an exhausted employee in a small lone, gloomy room of a restaurant. I wondered all the time whether they actually served anything at all. The exhausted employee asked us if we wanted the works, to which we simply replied ""sure"". The Pizza arrived in 10min. It was the fastest pizza order I ever received in town. And it was superb! I recommend all to come here at least once if not more, in their lifetime. 5/5",5,,909,Positive
"My friend and I wanted to try this place after seeing a review on Instagram. It was a little difficult to find since neither of us had been to Shakhertak. We ordered a Meat Lovers Supreme. The pizza arrived in 15-18 mins, piping hot. It was the kind of pizza one would find at a restaurant like Pizza Hut, which was a pleasant surprise. It does say ""Beef and Chicken"" in the pizza description but they came in sausage form and not their usual form. This was a bit unusual but not a bad idea. The dough was fresh, there was a good amount of cheese, the service was good, and the price was very very reasonable. I hope they continue doing what they're doing because it's working. I hope to visit them once again soon.",4,,715,Positive

"Thank you so much for existing. First time I ordered your pizza today and honestly was really skeptic about it. But you better write my address down somewhere and memorize it because I'm ordering again haha. Generous quantity of meat. Amazingly made. Sausages and Pepperonis were tender enough. Perfect crust. On just a small note I do think the onions are kind of a little turn off, but not much big of a deal. And the MiCasa sauce could be just a little less watery, but then again didn't keep me out. Money well spent. Keep this up and in no time you could be amongst the top pizzas in town. Edit: Order was delivered 20 minutes earlier than given time. Amazing punctuality. (Y)",5,,681,Positive

"Tried their poutine and impasto hot pasta, the poutine was quite delicious, and the heat of peppers in pasta was something exquisite, it hits you when you least expect it, its not something too overpowering but a subtle taste that goes well with all the ingredients, but the pasta was a bit runny, should have kept it under the broiler a tad bit longer. Had their fried rice too which they have placed as appetizer and it actually is properly put as the rice would not make you full but make you salivate and hanker for more. Overall had a very good experience.",5,,561,Positive

Let's get one thing clear. A restaurant like Chows has two things to offer. Cuisine and service. Food is great. Proportions are not. Service not good at all. They'll take orders only to return about it's unavailability or the excuse of how difficult it would be to serve hot n sour soup as they're backedup at the kitchen. One garcon even took my dinner plate along with cutleries thinking that i'm done eating. I thought he's giving me a fresh plate after i tried their delicious flash fried whole fish. But I was mistaken :) Great chef. Poor service.,3,,552,Positive
"Ambiance is perfect for any hangout. Interior is beautiful & serene. Food is also awesome.. The prawn har gow, chicken sui mai, chicken chilly with black bean sauce.. Though the beef item that we ordered could not stand up to our expectations. But overall it was a nice place to spend time with near & dear ones with delicious food added.",5,,338,Positive
Salt is a major concern. All the dishes that we had it was salty. Decor and service we're excellent. We reserved the private room.,3,,130,Positive
Well the food was good as usual. But a bit disappointed on the buffet offering during iftar. I thought the menu would be eat as much as you can but i was surprised with the appetiser being served once as set menu and buffet dinner on the five mains. Come on chows your edm for the offer was misleading,3,,301,Positive
By far The best Chinese in town. Food is excellent and so is the ambience & service. No wonder why the elites and diplomats living around patronise it so highly both at lunch and dinner. However prices of items in recent months have been jacked up. But then in a premium eatery one has to pay premium rates I guess.,5,,315,Positive
"I agree with some of the comments based on my experience. Great Food. Poor Service. This is the best way to summarize my experience at Chows. They really, really, really need to focus on service.",3,,195,Positive
"26th of March in the evening I was invited @chows hosted by my brother Azizur Rahman (Tel no 01713038440,) We ordered food but they failed to serve on time.

"After all the reviews about their service being not up to mark, i was a bit skeptical. But i was really surprised to find their service top of the line. They were very humble and veryyy nice. every person who came to our table and served us food had a big smile and they really do make u feel good about ordering and eating there. The food was just next level. My friends finished most of the appetizers by the time i was there but the 1s i did get to try were mind blowing. also ...their sauces are out of this world (especially this black bean sauce). i do not remember the name of the items but we had a fish a beef a chicken and noodles. each of them were perfect in their own way although i thought the noodles cud improve a wee bit. the fish (fish with black beans think) was the best. we all thoroughly loved the meal but my friends kept saying the appetizers (which i misssed) were better than the main course. Overall it was a great experience. i simply loved it. oh and the place is gorgeous and very well maintained. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",5,,1049,Positive
Very Nice Environment but waiter response very slow . Food is good but not best .,3,,81,Positive
"Had a dinner reservation for 3 and after reading several of the reviews on the page and suggestions from family and friends, decided to have a Dim Sum night. Placed 6 orders of various Dim Sums. The first one to arrive was the Steamed Spicy Glass Noodle Dumplings which were average, not my preference. I was quite taken away by the Steamed Mushroom and Herb Dumplings, sort of reminded me of the mushroom momos from Crepe o Momo. That's the end of vegetarian dishes and now my fa...vorite, the meat dim sums. The Chicken and Prawn Sui Mai were tasty, a little hot and would order again. The Beef Cheung Fung looked tastier than it really was. A friend described the taste as a savoury lychee. On the other hand the Crispy Prawn Cheung Fung was the highlight of the night and ended up ordering two of those. The last order was a Prawn and Water Chestnut Dumplings which I devoured with complete satisfaction. At the end of the night, I was full and content. To accompany the dim sum was still water, and service was normal, nothing extraordinary. Overall good dining experience, loved the decor and would visit again.",3,,1117,Positive

Just came back from Rice and Noodle. We went after your great Ramadan reviews so naturally had high expectations. Both our Prawn Pad Thai bowls had guess what JUST ONE prawn in it The Chicken Chowmein was clearly made of Cocola noodles and sadly our maid can make a better noodle dish. There was another rice dish which was so bad that I even forgot the name. I will not want to rate your place(i.e. 1 star is even too much) because seriously the experience was VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING.,4,,486,Positive

"I lived japan two years. That time i was falling in love for Sushi. Every weekend I ate lot of sushi. Last year i came back to bd, and thought in my entire life i will not eat sushi as good as sushi meijin in japan. But I was surprised to eat shamon sushi in Tokyo express, that was exactly same taste like sushi meijin in japan. But honestly speaking it is too expensive than japan, whereas japan was one of the most expensive country in the world, Thier food cost, labour cost is too high. But In bd why sushi price is too expensive compare to rice and beef sysling I don't understand. Whatever the sushi was too good. I am so happy to have it.",4,,646,Positive

"Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Tokyo express. Definitely one of the best value for the money places in dhaka. The menu was good, ambiance was great and the decor was neatly done. The service was on the mark - the waiters were prompt and knew about the items. Food worth remembering: shrimp tempura, Chicken nanban, spicy beef and salmon sashimi.",4,,354,Positive

"Decided to pay Tokyo Express a visit - took us few minutes to find the place. If you are coming from Gulshan-Banani Brdige-end Just do a left on Road 9 then take the first right. Restaurant is on the ground floor and before you reach the main entrance you pass a few tables occupied by mostly university student types and smokers. As I went in, first thing I noticed is that the restaurant has very poor acoustics and was very loud - specially the inside rooms. I asked the Waite...r to explain the menu as he did, I was unable to understand half of what he said - problem with both his English and Bangla pronunciation. The decor was average, Steel cutleries already showing wear and narrow ends of chopsticks are worn out â€“ the shiny coating has come off exposing the wood like material. Tokyo Express should provide disposable or better quality chopsticks as micro food particles can easily stick to the exposed material. We were just given one small empty sauce bowl for our soy sauce/wasabi mix to dunk our sushi - there were two of us and they should have given us two sauce bowl as I personally do not like to share my sauce bowl with others. We ordered the the assorted sushi dish, Chicken Nanban and Osaka spicy beef and fried rice. The Sushi tasted quite good 2 pieces each - of prawn, cuttlefish and salmon. The sushi rice could be of better quality. This would make the sushi extremely good. Chicken Nanban is an average dish but was quite delicious. Made with ice cube sized chicken breast pieces on a light sauce. Sauce tasted like Oyster sauce with soy sauce and sugar added in. A very plain dish. Osaka spicy beeft also tasted very nice - dry shredded beef cooked in hot and light teriyaki sauce and spring onion. The dish was quite tasty. Fried rice also tasted nice but seemed just a tad bit oily. Cooked in less oil the dish would taste just as good. The watermelon juice was average; it was naturally sweet but lacked body and volume. Bill was just above Taka 2000. For the price Tokyo express is a good value with decent food. Although I was not wowed by any of the dishes, I was not disappointed either. Definitely recommended for sushi (at least for the price) and casual lunch and dinner. The menu choice is very limited; I would advice the owners to add more items. >M.M",4,,2297,Positive

"Pretty much everything on the menu is awesome. Best dish: Tokyo Fried Rice, Grilled Squid & Octopus, and the Salmon Sushi (very fresh!)... The ambience/atmosphere is very cozy. Only 1 suggestion: do add green tea to the menu (hot & cold options) and it'll go perfectly with everything else.",5,,290,Positive
Great food. Imbuing dishes with a seasonal feel and bringing out the natural flavors of the ingredients are very important parts of this style of Japanese cuisine......Tokyo Express successfully done it. The restaurant- wait staff are all very polite and treat diners with exceptionally thoughtful hospitality.Their deep admiration of the seasons and warm thoughtfulness towards the customer reflects a sense of aesthetics that prizes tranquility and simplicity.,4,,462,Positive

Last not but the least desserts have also a different taste. I think, the rice needs to be a little bit improve. And 2/3 fish items... Just wonderful,awesome, mind-blowing.

I think the bun was a bit little compared to the chicken meat and come on, I wanted a burger, not salad. Though it tastes... Thumbs up for the chef will visit you soon.

"I don't know what happened 4 months ago with all these negative reviews. Sbarro had always been my most favorite pizzeria in Bangladesh. I'm almost a regular in this shop. I'm a big fan of their Gulshan outlet. Tobay I visited their Bailey Road outlet. Mr. Masud Rana served me all the way with kind and good professionalism. I ordered 1 NY cheese, 1 NY chicken tikka, 1 NY hot & spicy and 2 Iced lemon tea (My all time favourite). All of them tasted really good. Specially the NY... hot & spicy (Definitly recommended). Sbarro always served the most fresh dough or crust. It felt soft and well baked. They use just the amount of cheese the pizza needs. They do well with the pizza sauce they use. Perfect tasting pepperoni. Well seasoned. Not everyone is going to love all of the pizza flavours. But I think you'll definitly find one you'd love. I have jsut a small issue with the Iced lemon tea. Except mohammadpur and maybe dhanmondi outlet, I've been to every other one. In the original Gulshan outlet they use huge beer mugs for the Iced lemon tea. But in some other outlets you'll find them using thin narrow glasses to serve the lemon tea which is sad. And the taste varries from outlet to outlet. The taste is like a hit or miss. They should try to fix that. And I liked the fact that only they had their one signature 18"" sized pizzas in BD. I hated it when they started introducing different sizes for their pizza. Well, it's just me complaining. Happy feasting.",5,,1472,Positive
"It was our first visit to Sbarro, Mohammadpur branch... The first thing that impressed us was the hospitality of the staffs, specially Mr.Sunny... This all-time smiley faced person was very polite and friendly... We ordered Stuffed Crust Pizza with sausages and pepperoni and Iced Tea... Pizza was delicious and juicy and the Iced Tea was simply awesome... Thanks to Sbarro Bangladesh for giving us the original taste of Sbarro... :-)",5,,434,Positive

So we had a pizza which was available and it was good. Then they provided us with some coupons and told that we'll get 20% discount on these items till 15th October. Then again we went there after the day of opening and showed them the coupon but the servers said that those items were not available. The...y also said if I want to use these coupons and want to have that meal I have to go to another outlet as the mohammadpur outlet didn't have those meals. I mean it is already opened! Why does it still don't have combos and other things available? Every outlet has launched together so every outlet should also have same pizzas and other items available!

A very friendly welcoming place to spend a couple of nights. All personnel were very well trained and helpful (all done with a smile). Everything was handled with efficiency and attention to every detail was given. Food was delicious and Thanks (SANNY) for doing such an outstanding job to make the stay so pleasurable.,5,,319,Positive
"Tried out almost every slice of the pizza available on the menu today. The item Signature Stuffed Crust - Chicken and Broccoli was the best of all with its beautiful aroma and cooking style. i will give Sbarro the highest rating of all the pizza places I have ever been. And thanks to Staff member Miss Ranu Chowdhury for serving us with honor. Appreciate the good behavior and asking for our feedback. In a word, the food was good indeed. Totally worth it. And also I would like ...to add an extra suggestion in the end. The VAT is okay But I have never seen to take service charges from the customers or billing with VAT and SC or DC whatever. I would recommend that as the pizza prices are a bit high, so why not include or adjust the extra charges with the item prices. I hope this review would be taken into account seriously. Thank you.

"So I went there for the unlimited offer during Ramadan. Pizzas were really good. Hot, cheesy, crisp and tasty. All of the flavors were served. Service was satisfactory. Sunny bhai did a really good job. Drinks were watered down but it works for me coz I don't like the fizz. On the negative side, too crowdy and they added many extra tables and chairs. It was like a fish market ! The heat of the ovens neutralized the cold air of ac, so it was hot inside the restaurant. Food was good but atmosphere was horrible.",4,,514,Positive

Well your service was crap. Like no one came to serve us once in a while unless we called. And even then no one would respond most of the time. Pizzas were mediocre. Slices should have been smaller. The mushroom and classics were underwhelming. And the drinks... Arhhh. Ever hear of variety? Coca cola ain't the only soft drink.,3,,328,Positive

This is my first review. Went to Sbarro Bangladesh last week! If you are a pizza lover then you should definitely go there. So they serve 7 kinds of pizza . And I'm rating them according to how it tasted to me ... So here it goes. 1. Super supreme : 8/10 2. NY chicken Tikka: 9.5/10 3. NY cheese : 9/10 4. NY spicy beef: 8.5/10 5. Chicken Italian sausage :8/10 6. NY mushroom pizza : 7.5/10 7. Chocolate dessert pizza :8/10 Environment: 10/10 Everyone was absolutely well behaved. The atmosphere was energetic mostly cuz the game was going on. NB: the ratings above are based on my personal experience. It may vary from taste to taste.,5,,635,Positive

"We were 6 people yesterday and it was all our first time trying unlimited pizza and we're glad it was at Sbarro. The pizzas were quite good, but the service provided to us by Mr. Sajib was even better, which over all made it a good experience for us.",4,,250,Positive
"I guess they serve the best pizza in Dhaka and the fillings on the pizza were too delicious. More over, their service was too good. We got Shojib & Kakoli who served us really well & with their generous hospitality behaviour made us feel like home. We took unlimited pizza offer. As usual NY cheese, NY mushroom & chicken tikka hold their top position in my favorite list. Keep it up Sbarro. Good news: Sbarro is launching 8 more branches around Dhaka city soon. So, it's a request to Sbarro team, please always try to maintain the same quality as they are now. Cause many renowned pizza restaurants have degraded their quality gradually for profit.",5,,649,Positive
well i decided to give you 4 star but for MR.SHAJIB'S service I put 1 extra star here. and pizza was amazing as always.,5,,119,Positive

"Me and my friends went to Sbarro today and ordered the ""Unlimited Pizza Offer"". They served 6 different pizzas and a chocolate pizza. The size and taste of the slices were great. Service was fast. Seating arrangement was alright. I would like to thank Mr Mehedi & Mr Tarek for their generosity and hospitality. Their quailty of service far exceeded my expectations. Some recommendations:... 1. Needs more parking spots. 2. 2 toilets aren't sufficient. 3. Please add more chicken/ vegetable pizzas, as many people don't eat beef. Lastly, your hospitality is your biggest asset. Keep up the good work!",5,,599,Positive

You can have a look of what you are ordering for they have a sample for almost everything. The price is on higher side but it is eprth trying.

I had the meat delight & the chicken tikka pizza they had available that day. Both the pizzas were quite average.

"So no complaints about the food which was excellent or the price which I found reasonable. But the staff have massive problems communicating with the customer or operating the sales counters. So this afternoon I head in, the place is nearly empty and I ask for a stromboli that isnt vegetables based. Four different staff offer me three kinds of vegetable based stromboli for ten minutes before one of them realizes I want a meat based stromboli and apologizes that they don't ha...ve any, wasting 10 minutes of my life. Then I head to the counter to pay, at which point the girl behind the counter presses buttons on the computer for several minutes before realising that the counter doesn't work. She apologizes. I ask her if I should go to my seat and wait for them to bill me or whether I should leave the note with her and wait for them to give me the change. She apologizes, I repeat my question. Other waiters join her in apologizing. A small crowd of apologetic waiters gather around me as I ask my question seven times and get seven rounds of apologies from more and more waiters. Then someone figures out that they can open the counter with the key that's next to the counter. At which point they take my Tk 500 note and give me my 30 Tk in change in three torn 10Tk notes, all three of which were scotch taped down the centre. At this point I should have known better than to ask, but I went ahead and asked for a pizza sauce to go with the pizza.

The menu is a bit large for my standards but some people like choices. The staff and server were friendly from the start. The waiting time for our food was a bit longer than usual; maybe because they were making the food from scratch. The Garlic Mushroom was a bit dry; not as juicy as it should be. The Seafood Salad was fresh,... Oh yeah, one more thing, I felt like the plating was below par.

"Wish could give a higher rating !!! We had an office party there on 22 Dec 17 of 30 guests. We needed separate seating arrangements for gents and ladies with different aged kids. They just did what I wanted. Even they kept one separate room for mothers who need to feed their babies. As it was Christmas season, so the hall was superbly decorated. The seating arrangement was not that quite but sufficiently spacious. About food, they were exceptional in case of choosing items i...n comparison to other hotels who offer the buffet of the same price range. They did not have 2/3 types Biriyani/ Rice items or any other similar food. There was no duplication of any menu. Starter items like soup and other snacks were not typical and were delicious. Ther main attractions were Small Lobster and Beef Steak. In addition to that, they had seafood and fish items too. They had variety in dessert items which we could not try as we were almost full then. We never saw an empty dish there. Whenever it was finished they refilled it without any further delay.They maintained high standard food quality throughout. If I don't say about two persons in this review then it will be an injustice to them which I must not do. Our party was a successful one only because of Restaurant Manager Mr. Zilhaj Parvez. He made everything in a way that we all felt like home. He was always there to fulfill our every requirement. Along with him, mess waiters were also very polite and professional with a smiling face. Another person is Md. Tazul Islam, Senior Security Officer, and an Ex Military person who ensured our tension free foodie time. As there was a shortage of underground parking, we had to park our cars outside. But this man ensured us about the security and was there with his troops till last maintaining extreme professional attitude. At last, all of us came out from there with a smiley face and satisfied heart. We all will look forward to going there time and again. Hope they keep their standard up always.",5,,2007,Positive

Nice cosy place. I am not a sea food lover but their way of cooking impressed me. they serve the food at a reasonable price. I tasted Sea food bento and liked it. Owner should increase the space and open more branches. I would suggest to open a branch at Dhanmondi.,5,,265,Positive
"UNFORTUNATE ROACH INCIDENT: Good things first... I went there this summer thinking about their mango faludas which was highly recommended by ppl whose food accumen I trust... And man was I pleased! But unfortunately among the other things I ordered like their Larb Gai & the Grilled Chicken with sesame sauce which were great btw... I also ordered bowl of their Spicy Noodles and as soon as I tossed it once to cool it I noticed a tiny roach lying dead among other ingredients, which immediately killed my appetite to eat or revisit Fools Diner anymore... Recommendation for their owners: Get better lighting for the kitchen to be able to inspect your food before you serve it.",3,,677,Positive

"Went there for the 2nd time, this time for my wife's birthday, who's a minion lover. We called them earlier to book but apparently they do not allow bookings. So told them we would be coming at 6:30pm, they said they would help us get seats when we were there. Unfortunately dhaka traffic played us and we were 2.5 hours late!! However in the meantime we had a couple of attendees already there and they accepted our order. So soon after reaching the place we got our food. The food was really good. We had the hanging chicken with rice/pasta. The chicken with rice was a really good combo (350tk) and we also found the pasta to be really good. Overall a good experiance.",5,,671,Positive

I saw huge pressure and demand... for this they couldn't serve people properly which is another bad side!!

Tried their Hanging chicken with pasta. The chicken was tasty but unfortunately the pasta was incredibly bland. The cheese was chewy and rubbery. Nothing could salvage the horrendous taste.

I hitted 3 stars because i think overall is good. First of all I would just like to thank you for the fantastic evening we spent at your restaurant on Sunday 24th September 2017. Secondly i would like to say that I & my friends ordered BBQ chicken with Fried rice. Specially thanks for your service and your decoration was well decorated and i love that place. Your food quality was average and i didn't find any specialty from that food. Last but not least we had a great time and really appreciated the live entertainment too!â€œ Best of luck for your restaurant...,3,,567,Positive
"Pizza was very good.. but pasta was worse, it was smell like cow's fat. They serve tomato sauces in a tiny plate..this is really irritating. You have to ask them several times for sauces. Overall environment was good. Staffs are sincere.",4,,237,Positive
"So for my sister's birthday, we ordered takeout of the BBQ platter for four and got enough food to feed at least 6 people. To be honest, the food was mostly excellent. The Mexican rice was splendid. The chicken wings and the chicken sizzling were finger licking good. We found the green sauce too spicy, especially for those who can't consume spicy food. The disappointment was the BBQ chicken which weren't barbequed at all! There was no searing on the outside, the char a barbequed chicken is supposed to have was nonexistent. There was zero spice in it. Also, we found hair in several dishes which is totally unacceptable. I hope in future you'll improve your dishes more. Keep up the good work with the rice, the chicken wings and the chicken sizzling but please be more sincere about the quality and hygiene of your food.",4,,826,Positive

"Had a caramel latte today along with a sandwich (forgot the name), chocolate chip cookie and a date bar. The sandwich came with a sauce/chatni , the fillings were imported i guess, it is one of the best sandwiches I have had in the recent past. The coffee was also good. After a long time had tasted freshly brewed coffee. It was adequately prepared.Chocolate chip cookie was a bit like a brownie though, also liked the date bar. For coffee and sandwich I would rate it 5 star.",5,,477,Positive

"This place WAS amazing for 5-6 years straight till last year. Currently no one knows the actual status of its international franchisee license and clearly they don't care about the quality of food anymore. There used to be a time when this was country's only place for pizza and pasta. As many good competitors have risen up now, you don't have to eat the DRY, RUBBERY pasta, and TASTELESS, generic pizza they serve, not anymore. The well behaved waiters they have is a feeble attempt at justifying the ludicrous food they serve for the high price they charge.",5,,560,Positive

Previously: Worst delivery service. If you can't deliver in time then let the customer know while the order is placed. I had to call 5 times to track my order and just a sorry is not enough! So pizza Inn made it up to me with a complementary pizza after verifying their mistake. I appreciate it and I hope every customer who doesn't receive the value for money from you gets the same treatment in the near future. I have always been a regular customer of Pizza Inn and was very disappointed with this service. Thanks for making it up though.,3,,541,Positive

"One of the most customer-friendly places comparative to other restaurants I have visited within Dhaka. I along with two more people went there (mirpur branch) to avail unlimited pizza offer at about 6:40 pm without even booking & obviously it was houseful. We were wandering here & there & then the manager approached to us on his own & suggested to have iftar in staff room. We agreed as there was no other option left. Dates, rooh-afza & cold drinks were quickly served & just before azaan, two slices of pizza were given to each of us. Eventually they were serving pizzas of different flavor (8 flavors) after every while & the manager was repeatedly saying sorry that we had to have iftar in staff room. Though they had to serve a lot of pizzas to a huge number of crowd but still taste was not degraded.",5,,808,Positive

"It was great. I went for the unlimited pizza and bottomless drinks offer. Pizzas were delicious and adequate number of servings. I am quite satisfied by their service as well. Down side was the air conditioning systems were leaky and dripping water. They had shut off one of the doors to make room for more people which kind of made the place very stuffy with no room to walk. Otherwise, it was a good experience. Definitely going there next time.",4,,447,Positive

I went there with my friend and it was very difficult for both of us to eat it completely. The price is also reasonable as far as I do think. In fact, I would like to recommend that Pizza inn is one of the best places in Bangladesh where's food items hardly have any comparison in taste.",5,,475,Positive

"I liked the ultra thin crusted pizzas...but it seems the chefs often forget to season the pizzas properly. We went yesterday to enjoy the BOGO offer at Gulshan branch, pizzas were good but we had to add seasoning to make the taste perfect, the pizzas were under seasoned. Please ask your Chefs to check the seasoning while they make the products or before serving, I do believe it will make your products more tastier. Service and environment were nice, though the server never came to follow up at all. It was my first visit, I would like to request you to train your servers on how to follow up with customers as well, it creates good impression about the brand, isn't it? Thanks",4,,681,Positive

First of all give up the habit of hawking people like Gulistan to your restaurant..Haven't seen this ever at any elite restaurant of this area.. . had pasta here which was 3/5.. it lacked chicken and cheese horribly..you can hardly find any of these in the middle and last parts..I should also personally say it lacked salt and spice(don't know about other people).. I think you guys need to stop the buy 1 get 1 shit and instead bring up your focus to the taste... for decoration I would rate 4/5.. it looks good overall thanks to the decorators.. Best of luck for future.. hope you guys can make quick improvement and cope up with the other famous restaurants in the food valley named Khilgaon ï¿½,3,,699,Positive

Its just lack of training.i worked and study in hotel management abord and I run many places abord so I have bit idea in hospitality sector so I hope the management will see my review and they will fix those small issue.

Actually they were great for me. Whatever lets talk about the food! 1st of all there wasn't 50 items as they claimedâ€‹! And most of the items were good but not the best!! Fried rice and noodles and chicken chili was great. That tikka item was great. The biggest downfall is, there wasn't any beef or sizzling items!! I didn't liked the pasta...it was bad! And you guys should add more desserts please, Because the dessertsâ€‹ sucked big time! I would never recommend shemai and firni in a buffet menu!! At least throw some cakes or chocolates. Maybe you guys mixed up the menu because of the Ramadan! I hope you will improve the menu in future! Thanks for your services ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½",4,,865,Positive

We had a get together here on december 12.we triedd the lunch buffet there. The items were okay but not extraordinary.

Its a good place to hangout with friends and family ï¿½ ï¿½,4,,352,Positive
"Overall food is good. However, there is a improvement opportunity in desert items. Like to provide two quality items instead of 4 average items. Pasta could be a better one instead of macaroni and the sauce used in crab need to be a quality one. Others are up to mark.",4,,268,Positive
"Last night I was there... soup was awesome... I liked their pasta... I really don't like their desserts... I was expecting more dessert there...#payesh,shemai are the common dessert.. we can eat at home... I think you guys should add more dessert there... Overall Thnq...",4,,271,Positive

"This is by far the best pizzas I've had here at BD. Made by a man full of passion and dedication, I'd rate this a 10/10. The presentation of the pizza is beautiful. Its very neat and pleasing to the eye. I personally had the BBQ chicken pizza and the shrimp pizza and it tastes amazing. The meat is well cooked and tender. The meat alone tastes outstanding. The texture of the pizza is wonderful. Though it is layered by the sauce and meat and the cheeses on top, it still holds everything in place. It doesnt get soggy or soft which is essential for a good pizza. And not to forget, every bite gives you a very satisfying cheese pull which is to die for ðŸ˜ Overall, i would highly recommend.",,TRUE,693,Positive

"A person who knows me can tell that I just live for good food and I love eating at different places where it is a 5 star or anything else. The Friday brunch of Four Points by Sheraton is awesome to treat yourself after a hectic week. It is a place which is very soothing and their staffs will make sure that you'll feel cozy there. I have been to Le MÃ©ridien, Westin and Raddison too but if you ask me which place serves you the best food then I'll say it is Four Points by Sherat...on. Now let's talk about the food, the best thing they will serve you is live juice station from the entire brunch session. The live kitchen has a variety of items to offer and to me the prawn tempura and the omelette with cheese were the best. They also serve you live pasta station. I had the best white sauce pasta with cheese, spices and chicken today. It was so yummy that I had the desire to start licking the plate. The main dishes were yummy too. The main thing is they will set a line of main dishes that you will want to eat like no dishes you'll not want to eat. I had a very good experience today there and I highly recommend this place.",5,,1133,Positive

"Well we had 1 ifter and 2 sehri in Four points, it is one of the indication of their improved menu and services! As their tower section is the new addition in the Ramadan menu, I must said they are providing great foods. Ramadan teaches us not to waste, so i tried to eat as much as possible but not keep any weste foods in the plate! I like the most is they did not put tons of variety rather quality foods and all that you can eat. All the stuffs are very friendly, they keep asking the guests if they need anything more. They tried to provide the best possible service. Apart from that. The view from the 24th floor is awesome! The manager Mr. Tareq and assistant manager Mr. Shaifur Rahman provide quality service and they are always on the move, asking guests if they were happy or not! Overall, we are satisfied customers! :)",5,,831,Positive

"quantity was there .. but lacked quality somewhat. nothing spectacular or exceptional to make it a stand apart experience. it was nice of them to include the juice bar with the buffet & service was upto the mark too. quality of beef being served can be improved, i found it bit hard to chew. desserts section was unimaginative .. lots of different types of cupcakes .. again nothing exceptional was noted.. lacked chocolate based items or any mousse & yogurts were missing too. BIGGEST DRAWBACK WAS SERVICE STOPPING AT 3:30 pm. In context of Bangladesh, it should have been minimum 4:00 pm. & a closeby smoking section would be nice. having 2 change lifts to get to their rooftop smoking area wasn't fun.",3,,704,Positive
"Tried buffet , average , a bit frustrating as majority items are not tasty. Good part availability of juices in buffet . Our expectation is higher , hope to see you like that , Good Luck:)",3,,188,Positive
"foods were fantastic and MS. Cecilia Gomes (asst. manager-sales) was so cordial and showed us venue, room and swimming pool. It was a great time in Four Points by Sheraton Dhaka. I'll definitely come with my family as well as love to recommend my friends, family and colleagues to enjoy excellent service of this hotel.",5,,319,Positive
Review#1 Great new food joint in Dhaka City. Refreshing and mouthwatering. My new favorite place for buffet. Review#2 Simply Great. the best sea food place in town.,5,,164,Positive
"Very nice family place with good ambiance. Good food and better service. Will come again surely. Beverages should be included with the buffet. When you've advertised that the price mentioned is of all inclusive, then charging of VAT & others shouldn't be in place.... That doesn't bring good news to YOU. Anyway, overall I liked it and visit again to see new developments. Cheers!",5,,380,Positive
"Staff were really friendly, everything works, loved it",5,,54,Positive
Foods variety r very impressive. All items r premium.. They need to improve their Dessert section as they have limited selection.... Only bad side is they didnt offer me any drinking water...,4,,191,Positive

Ambiance & decor is good. The staff service was good. Food was average. Coffee was like being in a canoe - so close to water !!! However what peeved me was the staff trying to speak in English with an accent. The management and staff should know that there is no shame in speaking in Bangla to the Deshi customers. Will I be back? Probably - if someone treats me...,3,,365,Positive
"Located at the heart of the modern part of Dhaka, just at Gulshan-2 circle. the 28-floored Doreen Tower has been modified as this hotel. Though some of its floors are being used as office spaces but completely isolated from the hotel. They have started new, some of their staffs I met have been recruited from other hotels like Westine, Amari etc. and they know well how provide service to customers. Their restaurant and food menus I experienced found very selective and well cooked. Restaurant is in 24th floor with good view of outside. Specially their restaurant lounge at 27th floor will give you a splendid beautiful overview of the city which must be liked by all to have some time there to drink, smoke or to dine with nearest ones, so don't miss it!",4,,758,Positive

"Dear All, Iâ€™m writing this for warning about a person who is a terror, land mafia and hypocrite in Chakaria Upazella, Coxâ€™s Bazer. His name is Jafor Alam Chairman â€“ chairman of Chakaria Upezala. I came to know that he is doing lobbing to be a MP Coxâ€™s Bazer, also note that he is not much educated and his all surrounding people are not good enough. Besides he is doing Awamilig. As I respect this Politics Party due to Nation Father Banga Bandhu Sheck Mujebur Rahman, But Mr. JAf...or Alam is using name and fame of Bangladesh Awamilig which is very unfortunet for us and me. This will be very dangerous for all chakaria upezala residence because he will make more black money and make more terrorism and land mafia in chakaria. If Hines, Prime Minister of Bangladesh Mrs. Shak Hasina approve him to be a MP of Chakaria then it will be wrong decision.

Quality of food - 3/5 Presentation - 4/5 Authenticity/Originality of food (Srilankan Cuisine) - 2/5 Taste - 2/5 (used to be better) Price (value for food) - 1/5... Environment - 3/5 Staff - 4/5 Overall - 2.5-3/5 Food we(4) ate on 20.1.2017. Kottu Roti - very good Yellow Rice - averate Chicken red curry - not near to srilankan style cyrry which i had at srilanka. It was more like Bangla style. Beef Nugamba or something (cant remember the name) - same as chicken curry. Although a bit different but doesn't have any srilankan touch. Moju - very good. The food was really good when I went there on the 1st month of their opening.,3,,630,Positive
Very nice environment. Good to be home!!!,,TRUE,41,Positive
"For the 1st time I test Sri Lankan food and this is amazing experience. Coconut Toffee is just like haven and the smell of Butter Cake , too much good. test of Lemonade is little bit different then regular Lemonade. Fiery Wings is also good. The owner welcome us with a smile and ask abut the quality and the test of the food. and he is concern about our comfort. The staff is so well behaved ... Overall i like this place",5,,422,Positive
Peaceful ambience. Food is tasty and has great quantity. Totally will go again.,5,,79,Positive
"That was the first time for all of us. We were 3 in numbers. As heard before, we went there in quest for a bit spicy food. And they stood perfectly up to our expectations. The ambiance totally goes with the Sri Lankan theme. It was very homely and cozy. We had a great meal. Last, but not the least, the icing of the cake was.. the complimentary ice creams. I wish Taste of Lanka the very Best Wishes.",4,,401,Positive
"A real, ""authentic"" taste of Lanka. Though a bit expensive, but no compromise with taste and quality. Grilled Prawn, Devilled Chicken and Coconut Ice Cream was best! Devilled Fish was unavailable but I bet it would be the better dish if they have it available. I would like to taste the Giant Crab next time.",5,,308,Positive
Food was a bit spicy but we liked the taste and the service.. good environment to hangout with fnf ï¿½ And lastly we loved the complimentary coconut ice cream ï¿½ï¿½,4,,165,Positive
A neat place with good food. The chilli crab is one of my favourite along with deviled chicken & hoppers. Crab items are often out stock though. Also the place is a little pricey & there is room for improvement in service.,4,,222,Positive

Coconut milk ice-cream yammmmi! I fall in love on that ^_^,3,,58,Positive
Great food. Unnecessarily pricey for the proportions served. It's just average Sri-Lankan food. Not fine dining in any ways.,3,,124,Positive
"3 of us attended for lunch. The decor was minimalist but clean. The waiters were pleasant but need proper training. As this is a new cuisine for most of us, we had to ask for recommendations. This was not voluntarily offered. Even after we advised them of our lack of knowledge about Sri Lankan food. The waiter appeared to suggest the most expensive dishes as opposed dishes that we'd like considering we were describing what we were in the mood for. Ordering the food was a chal...lenge. We ordered a set menu they had available as this would provide the most selection. We also ordered parathas, egg hoppers and a beef curry. The waiters did not make suggestions that we'd need to order this additional food but it was essential for a full meal. It took over 20 minutes for the food to arrive. Once it did, I admit it was tasty but most of it was very spicy. We were not aware of this. We can handle spice but we still would've appreciated the waiters making us aware of it. The staff mentioned 3/4 of our way through the meal that we had two drinks which came with the set menu that we'd ordered. Whether this was done to make us order more drinks or whether the waiters forgot....both are unattractive. The set menu was priced in a manner I would say appropriate but the curry was overpriced. It cost just under 4000tk for 3 of us and in all consideration, this was a tad over what we would've felt was appropriate. I hope the suggestions are considered thoughtfully. I enjoyed the food so we shall be back, inshallah.",3,,1523,Positive
"The food was fantastic ,too spicy,too yummy ï¿½ I'll visit you again ï¿½ï¿½",5,,75,Positive
"The food was okay... but the service was terrible... th waiter told us tht it's going to take 20 minutes, but they served th food after 50 minutes!!!! The funniest thing is that they served the starter (chicken wings) after They served the main course... ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Another thing is that they must rethink bout the portion of the rice they serve for 2 ppl in th platter!!!",3,,374,Positive
Tried the set meal for two. The taste was great but the service was a little bit slow.,5,,86,Positive
"Went to taste of lanka today.had lunch there with family.I really like their food.interior decoration,hospitality,clenness,taste of food is appreciable ! Wish them all the best!",4,,177,Positive
"The service was very good and the food was good too. The egg hopper, the egg rotti were just perfect along with deviled squids and the negombo beef curry. The pol sambol wasn't upto the mark though. They should add some more variety coz Sri Lanka offers a variety of dishes. Suggest to add Sri Lankan Tamil variety too especially the Jaffna style preparation which is more rich in flavor. Lovely staff and good ambience too",5,,423,Positive
Just the perfect flavor of spice I love...Service is excellent.Food serving time is perfect. All the items we ordered were freshly prepared and warm enough.,5,,156,Positive

This place is one of the only two decent seafood restaurants in Dhaka. This one provides a greater value for money and heartier portions. Did you ask for a single saucer of dipping? They'll give you 5 different sauces and an assortment of condiments. Did you ask for the menu? They'll land a 500 page illustrated epic noble of fishes and crustaceans on your table. Don't miss out on their chowder of the day.,5,,408,Positive

"I loved all of the food from Manhattan but its So disappointed! Extremely unprofessional! You guys should do a thorough background check before hiring druggheaded criminals as your employees! If people can't have their meals in peace outside, then why pay service charge? No waiter or manager of any company has the right to physically and mentally attack a customer like this! And please, fire all the employees who are even slightly associated with this. Its a request. I understand you guys have a global reputation, but its not more important than a person's life.",,TRUE,568,Positive

"We ordered their bowl-less pasta which is quite hyped these days. We had to wait for over 30 mins and their waiters were acting like the last nabab of bengal and it was hard to get their attention but everything was compensated when the food arrived. The pasta was exquisite, well cooked pasta mixed with few pieces of chicken and sausage with a well balanced sauce and cheese, the crust was crunchy and went quite well with the cream, cheese and other bits as well. Overall the whole thing was a beautiful package of bursting tastes that will explode in your mouth. To me, the food of a restaurant has the highest priority that's why I had to give it 5 stars, if i take their service into consideration, I might have given them 0. Happy fooding all!",5,,750,Positive

You smell the 'ghee' from the far distance and keep wondering the food/ kabob must be good here! Sorry to break the news fellas. It's all about the dirty marketing strategies. They spread layers of ghee near the exhaust pipe and beautiful aroma is all around the restaurant. But the first bite of kabob is just enough to determine how horrible and low quality food they serve. Sure the food is cheap but taste matters! Avoid this restaurant altogether!!,5,,453,Positive

"We had the following (opposite NSU main gate 1 & 2): 1 Beef Burger = 99 Taka. Was pretty good. Loved the buns they use. The patty was good for the price range, despite being doused with a lot of sauce. Also, it is a very messy burger so make sure you get tissues. 2 Chicken Burgers = 198 Taka. The chicken burger is definitely the best item on the menu. Delicious patty which complements the soft sesame buns. They use the same sauces for both the beef and chicken burgers. Howeve...r, the sauce combo tastes much better with the chicken patty. 1 Beef Kebab = 99 Taka. The packaging is nice, the kabab wrap is decent. It is definitely not worth getting this for 99 taka. Also, the beef kebab has star anise in it, so if you don't like the smell of star anise, stay away from it! 1 Chicken Kebab = 99 Taka. Again, the chicken version is much better than the beef version. Still not worth 99 taka IMO. The meat to veggie ratio is waaaay off. They need to put more meat in this to be worth 99 taka. Tastes pretty good though. 1 Mountain Dew = 60 Taka. Regular fountain drink glass (not the tiny ones they give you at KFC or other places). Expensive yes, however it was pretty refreshing. Tasted like proper mountain dew (not some watered down version of it). Recommendations = stick to the chicken burgers. Definitely worth it!",4,,1324,Positive
"went to Baba rafi 300 feet Bashundhara r/a they only serve 100 and 160 tk combo burger deal! One of the best burger in that price,, but i have to give points to fries,,its similar to Mcdonalds fries and Hungry Jacks i had in Australia. Beef Burger was juicy and the sauce they used was really nice with a hint of Garlic Im gonna be honest, i had most amount of burgers around dhaka from banani, malibag and mirpur, dhanmondi and 300 feet... Baba rafi beats all in price and taste and with excellent cooked fries! Top quality. Thats why i had two burgers!! N.B- every place we been to, customer service is never satisfactory, but this girl in baba rafi,,,she was kind, explainable and also served with smile where she was wearing hijab and with decency,,,5star for because she did that. Thanks for the experience. keep up the good work!",5,,835,Positive

"Now this is confusing . How can a shop have 68 5 stars and 34 1 stars? Some r sayin faltu, shit, rotten meat, served cold. Some are sayin they didnt find any meat in it, it was just tomato n onion or even thr service is slower than granny . N some r saying this is the best burger in town, nothing is better than this. Is it like the owner pushed his friends to give good reviews ? Or is it like those who suffered are mean enough to want others to suffer as well? Didnt try anything yet . After going through the reviews, i got confused . So.....its just a question that came into my mind.",3,,590,Positive

The Jazz Lovers platter definitely found a place in our favourite platter lists. The sauce on the steak was the cherry on the top and the whole combination definitely deserves a star.

"Good food, good service and live show: The restaurant took the effort to cut through the menues which are no more available. Thumbs up for that. Plus the foods are good and freshly prepared. We were satisfied with the T-Bone steak (preparation time and taste) and Chicken Wrap. My kid loved the live performance. The service was smart and polite. Most likely among the best all rounder restaurent in the Khilgaon food street. However, I have bad experience in restaurants where they were good, and became lathergik later. So, consistency will have to be checked in regular basis.",4,,579,Positive
